Our children adored the stories and illustrations and they wanted us to read them every night at bedtime. By following along as we read Lobel's and other ""I Can Read"" books, our children learned to read before they entered school. The stories are definitely designed to facilitate reading skills but they are also engaging, with a focus on friendship, love and behaviour. I cannot recommend these charming books enough.

Now for the negative comments: The Kindle versions are extremely disappointing; the font and illustrations are quite small. One can double tap and increase the font size a little bit, in small sections. This doesn't allow for reading to a child while smoothly running a finger under the words being read, as it would if all of the text on a page was enlarged at once. Running a finger under the text is a significant step in teaching a child to read while using ""I Can Read"" books, so this particular ""double tap"" method defeats that purpose.

In addition, the illustrations don't seem as vibrant as in the hardcover books and they can't be enlarged. The publisher did a real disservice to both the author and the readers by the poor job they did in transferring the books into digital format.

Even with my dislike for the way in which the publisher digitalized this book, it is still a very worthwhile purchase. It's message is timeless and the stories and illustrations are sure to appeal to both it's target audience and to the adults reading it to them.",Incredibly Good Book; Kindle Version Very Disappointing,1485129600,,-0.8,30.0,Days with Frog and Toad (An I Can Read Book)

We have never read the Frog and Toad books, but somehow just by listening, he latched onto the plots of all the stories and loves them and asks repeatedly to have this two-disc set played for him while he quietly plays in his playroom.

Just a head's up for any parents who might be interested:  either Toad or Frog at one point scolds the other, ""shut up!"" which led to a many-days-long issue with my boy here at the house.  It has passed, but it was unpleasant while it lasted.  Also at one point one of them says ""he is trying to kill me!"" and that word hasn't been introduced in our house yet.  Not a big deal but if you're playing these stories for really little ones, it's something to be aware of.

Also for whatever reason, the story called The Lost Button rubs my kid the wrong way, HARD, and we have to be ready to skip ahead or else deal with a meltdown.

EDIT TO ADD:  My son is now almost 4 1/2 and he still listens to this disc at least twice a week.  He has outgrown his fear of The Lost Button.  I highly highly recommend this CD.

EDIT JULY 2014:  My boy is 5 1/2 and still this is on constant rotation.  Several times a week, and now he also acts it out when it's not playing.  A+++++.",3 year old listens to it over and over,1329955200,,-0.4,30.0,Days with Frog and Toad (An I Can Read Book)

I remember why Lola isn't my favorite Perkins girl. She just seems really dramatic and young. I don't mind it. It just comes off kind of eh.

Another thing I hate is her unhealthy relationship with Max. I mean seriously. He calls her Lolita only after they have been intimate and it is disgusting. She even acknowledges it. Why does he have to be 22? What does that add to the story besides a creepy vibe. She obviously knows that it's not okay because she tries to lie about her age and always get defensive of their relationship when someone brings up the age difference. There is a big difference in mental maturity between a 17 year old and a 22 year old. Compared to say a 25 year old and a 30 year old. At 17 you are still a minor. Nothing is legal for you yet. You may feel mature but a lot of growing happens between 17 and 22. A lot of new experiences and such.

I am all for dressing how you want and what makes you happy but her costumes are a little over the top. At one point she goes to school in a bed sheet. A literal white bed sheet she made into an Egyptian style dress. She dresses so bizarre that no one even recognizes her when she dresses plain. She gets so upset that people don't know who she is when she is 'normal' Lola but who really knows the real Lola?

Exceptional dialogue and character creation--the characters' sense of humour was so witty and natual. But the stakes weren't very high ... what WERE Anna's stakes?

Anna is an example of a ""Spunky Kid"" personality type done perfectly and loveably (to start with). In the beginning I smiled while reading her thoughts and conversations, but she wasn't striving for anything. I didn't like not knowing her goal. It had to be something other than getting the guy at school, right? I mean, she liked the guy back home. At least there was no insta love here.

I wrote the following periodically whilst reading the book. It contains ***SPOILERS***

20% Nothing the author has told in narrative so far comes across as forced or fake--the writer's invisible. Such a rare talent! But the main conflict seems already to be miscommunication on the hero's side, which I can only put up with for a couple chapters before needing something fresh. The supposed conflict of Meredith also liking St. Clair (hero) seems to ALSO be one that could be cleared up with a quick, honest chat (my most hated form of conflict to read, but the easiest to plot).

Even so, I'm thinking, ""I am going to rate this 5 stars. Wow, I finally found a five star book!"" I love all the interactions, especially the ones between the hero and heroine. Their personalities mesh so naturally. BUT I'm confused as to why St. Clair is leading Anna on when he has a girlfriend. I'm trusting this is going somewhere plausible.

30% Plot has been dragging. Miscommunication still in use, annoying me. I REALLY need something to happen--a twist or an event that sets something different in motion. A different conflict please!

Okay, a character just got some disturbing news, but it doesn't change the plot or give Anna a strong desire for something, even if it IS a guy.

45% I'm DREADING that the kiss described in the title will only come nearing the end. That MOST of the plot is going to be this ""when will they kiss/get together?"" wrung out to the bitter end. Which--I'm sorry to say--is encouraging me to start skimming. I need more from the story than witty and fun conversations between friends, and outings with a guy she thinks she might like, while they both hide their true feelings.

50% I'm lecturing myself to keep reading. I don't care how it'll end--I can speculate that well enough, and thinking I'm only half way to the ending is ... Well, reading the two MCs hold back their feelings in every. single. scene. together is torturous enough up to this point. And not the good kind of torture. I'm at the ""enough already!"" stage. WHY IS HE STILL WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND WHEN HE'S SO TURNED ON AND JEALOUS AROUND ANNA? Is he a weak coward?

70% It's not going anywhere but circles, and I'm so disheartened because it had started so great and the writing is good.

75% This author does excellent arguments between the love interests. So real! I felt every word from both of them. He FINALLY made me understand why he'd stayed with his girlfriend while crushing hard on Anna (still wrong), but I can understand why Anna was still hurt by it. They needed this. NOW they can move on and forward. At bloody last! Now he can break up with Ellie, the poor thing. I'd hate to be her with him as a BF. BRILLIANTLY done scene!

77% The opposite of brilliant. I want to screaaaaaaaaaam with frustration. Nothing. Has. Changed.

79% Seriously? I can see the author conveniently throwing things between these two. Not in an ""oh, no,"" way (caring), but more like, ""someone slap them!"". I didn't think I could not like this girl (Anna), but I'n starting to. She is no longer a ""Spunky Kid"" personality type--who IS she? I can see the author's puppetry hands, and they STINK.

80% Nobody's excuses are lining up any more. They all need a slap of sense. I hate that. I'm resenting them all. The plot and conflict is so contrived now, it's like so, so many fanfictions. And I've read a LOT to know! This easy-to-do miscommunication plotline is why I rarely read fanfics any more.

82% There's a formula the author uses over and over and over in this book (fanfiction-like, too). And it's just happened again. Again! The main couple get really, really close, ALMOST kissing... teasing the reader... but they either get interrupted or fall into a conversation. This time they just HAD to talk instead. Why? I have no freaking clue! They act like a couple and flirt constantly but won't kiss, even though they want to. Obviously it's because that's the ONLY plot device the author knows to keep readers reading.

84% NO! One word: CONTRIVED! The author is a good writer, but a terrible storyteller/plotter. THAT is the new problem? Cliche much? So weak and annoying. Also, the kiss has been dangled and teased for so long, and my feelings have lessoned so much for Anna and him (HE'S a tease), that I felt nothing when they finally kissed. I also thought the kiss would have been written well--the book's title has the word KISS in it--but it was very...basic. Bland, even. Okay, maybe I've read too many good kissing scenes in fanfiction, but shouldn't ""real"" authors write them better?

87% I think I hate Anna. I hate people who are hot, cold, hot, cold. The TEMPER on the girl! Her fun personality has deteriorated into a melodramatic, emo bitch! I would not want her as a friend. Man, and her double standards.  And I can't believe the plot has turned into ""the alpha bitches are against the heroine."" I don't care if she is upset.

90% Sigh. Fist-fight over heroine. This book better have a sex scene at the end to make up for how much teeth enamel I've ground away.

91% Wow, even their would-be-second kiss gets interrupted. *rolls eyes*

99% Oh, god, it ended. Thank god it FINALLY ended. And even duller than I'd imagined. No twist, just a long talk about misunderstandings that had lasted ALL. BOOK. LONG.

The main character is Ada, a brave disabled 10-year-old girl that overcomes many challenges. Other Characters: Jaime (Adas little brother), Susan (Adas caregiver), Ms. Smith (Adas Friend).

The story took place in 1935 during World War I in London when children need to leave to the countryside to avoid the war. Ada teaches herself how to walk and also learns how to deal with her own problems while taking care of her brother.

My favorite character is Ada because she is a leader, takes care of her brother, and she helps people. I think other people will like this book because it will inspire people to overcome their struggles.

Yes the science is all weird. And they still use money?  Yes the mother got beyond boring with the anti Bush thing.  Especially since, in the end, the government, presumably headed by the hated President in Texas, got food flowing.  The anti Christian thing was also a bit ridiculous.

I wanted to strangle the mother at a few parts in the book.  Once the family is given some fresh eggs.  I thought that would make the mother think: OH, chickens and roosters.  Lets find some.  But no, once eaten, the eggs are gone.  The mother is so passive during this whole book I sometimes wanted to scream.  Like, why didn't they get a rifle?  My understanding is that Pennsylvania is overrun with deer (ie food). But no, Mom just waits for rescue. (From the hated President)

The part that makes up for the flaws was the age of the narrator. She wouldn't have paid much attention to the science or the president, so it makes OK sense. She relys on Mom to deal with things, which I found appropriate. She's a kid, she doesn't know what else to do.

The villain had an interesting backstory, but we learn very little about him before he is killed and he suffers from the pure evil psychopath trope.

But then this book came up on sale and me being the addict I am, I bought it and ended up reading it too! And now I must report that I absolutely loved it.

Katsa is graced with the power to kill. That has never endeared her to the people of her country but her uncle, the king, has use for her. Sending her off on missions to dole out bloody punishments, her uncle keeps her under his thumbs. But Katsa has other plans and starts a council that helps people in need of it. On a mission for the council, Katsa meets Prince Po and her life takes on an unexpected turn. Getting to know her Grace and understanding it better, Katsa realizes that she can be much more. Prince Po is beside her in every step of the way. But things change as Katsa defies her king and Prince Po finds a lead to the man behind the kidnapping of his grandfather. They head out on an adventure that will reveal dangerous secrets and change the destiny of a kingdom and their lives will not be the same ever again.

I loved Katsa. Well, I always had a soft spot for female assassins and Katsa only manages to take it a step forward. Her no nonsense attitude and her need to be in control is something that I found endearing. Prince Po is the perfect match for Katsa. He is strong, reliable and in control too. Together they form a formidable duo. I also liked the side character of Prince Raffin. I couldn't help but wish to read more about him. Bitterblue turned out to be an old soul in a childs body.

The author is an experienced teacher who knows well the minds of first graders in the US. She knows the level of vocabulary, the adequate difficulty and subjects that are of interest to them. These books will help readers get practice into reading more and pull them away from a screen at times. The basic plot of a book that transports the reader to other worlds is obvious and trite for an adult reader, but it is okay for a young reader who encounters it here probably for the first time.

The Bad: The paper on which they are printed is sadly of the poor off-white porous quality of a mass market bestseller. Page design is also bare bones, printer simple and easy on the eye while scalable if you opt for the e-book version.  The poor quality of the actual object will probably not instill a love for the book itself. They will be used, and then circulated to a library. Not a keeper.

I couldn't wait to get it and read it with my little guy - and boy oh boy was I surprised to find that it feels kind of racist in today's day and age. It's completely harmless, but one just doesn't say things like ""and that's why the Chinese give their sons short names today"" anymore. It just feels weird! I'm not crazy about the fact that the mom in the book is really nice to her elder son and mean to (or at least disinterested in) her younger son, but that didn't bother me as a kid (probably because I'm the older sibling). The whole name, which was so much fun to say as a kid, now feels kind of racist, like hearing someone pretend to speak Chinese by saying, ""ching chong chang."" But the thing I really can't get over is how bad the problem solving is in the book - it kind of implies the whole culture is unable to do basic root cause analysis. Is it terrible that I read the last page as, ""And that is why all wells in China are fenced off, so that children can't accidentally fall in them"" rather than ""and that is why all children in China have short names""?

I will say that Heartbreaker did not grab me from the start.  It took several chapters for me to really get into the book.  The problem for me was there was a lot of unnecessary information about characters that didn't really contribute to the storyline, and information that didn't move the storyline forward.  It was just a lot of detail that didn't really go anywhere.  However, about 1/3 of the way into the book I was hooked.

I'm a fan of Sanderson's epic fantasy--I enjoyed Elantris and the Mistborn trilogy. And I love listening to his insights on the Writing Excuses podcasts. (Really recommend these to any writers, especially those of speculative fiction!)

That said, I've always thought Sanderson's prose could benefit from more effort and polish. I think his strengths lie instead with his amazing world-building and magic systems. In Elantris and Mistborn, he crafts complex and compelling worlds that left me shaking my head in awe.

And that was completely missing from this story.

Steelheart is not epic fantasy--I would call it a dystopian with superheroes. Maybe Sanderson is just best with pure fantasy. (I sincerely hope he didn't slack on this one BECAUSE it is YA.) Anyway, the premise itself has promise: Following a cataclysmic event, some people developed superpowers and became ""Epics"" ... but using these powers makes the Epics evil, and it's up to ordinary humans to take them down by discovering and exploiting their unique weaknesses.

Sadly, the story that follows falls very flat.

The protagonist, David wants to kill the supervillian Steelheart because the man killed his father. We see this murder happen in a prologue rife with tension. Personally, I would have liked to have felt more about David's father, throughout the story, in order to be on board with revenge for his death as the driving factor in this narrative. But David's motive, though predictable and superficial at times, is at least clear.

David himself did not work for me as a protagonist, however. He's supposed to be eighteen, but felt much younger, pretty immature at times. He spoke in lots of sloppy metaphors that were supposed to be comic relief, I think, but they yanked me out of the story instead as I tried to figure out what they meant (especially when they were written into the narrative, and not just thrown into David's dialogue). And when David wasn't tossing around meaningless metaphors, he was ogling the beautiful female lead, Megan (seriously, he pretty can't mention her name without reminding us how hot she is and how much he's attracted to her).

Mainly, the novel didn't seem like anything I hadn't already seen in dozens of superhero movies, where the underdog male hero Saves The Day. All the characters felt more like caricatures, and I was never invested in any of them.

I will say that I did like Steelheart's weakness--it's extremely fitting for the story--though I'm not sure how David comes to the realization, when he does.

All in all, a disappointing read, especially when I'd been so excited to see a YA novel from Sanderson. I won't be reading the sequels.",Disappointed,1461715200,,-0.8,65.0,Steelheart (The Reckoners)

Steelheart was one of the most thrilling rides I've ever been on. Not that I expected anything less from this author. The man is beyond brilliant.

The world building Sanderson comes up with is just off the charts. He is the most imaginative, creative sci-fi writers ever.

The writing in this book was amazing and powerful. He truly brings everything thing to life. The characters, as always, were so real. I don't know anyone who can bring characters to life as well as Sanderson.

Plot execution was brilliant to say the least, as it is in all his books. From the very first page to the very last sentence, I devoured this book. You will NEVER find yourself skimming through a Sanderson Sci-fi book. It's just that good.

If you like books that are fast paced and full of shocking WTF moments. You'll love this.
Book 2 release is fall of 2014. Sigh... But, you can't rush perfection.
FYI- for those who hate cliffhangers. Book 1 ends, but is left open for book 2. I don't consider it a cliffhanger.

My only concern is the Underland Chronicles, like The Hunger Games set, leaves one feeling so much empathy for the charactors.  It makes you think about violence, conflicts, war in general in a real and frightening way.
As a military veteran and retired law enforcement officer I must say Collins hits the target on the emotional struggles involved in both war and conflict resolution.  Somehow she manages to make one feel what most veterans can never express.

It is a significant story of horrifying conditions for people in Sudan, Africa.  And because either humor or tragedy keeps us interested in a book, you will find this one very hard to put down.

Yes, I am very glad that we (the international community) are able to read various young men's stories of survival, as they are recognized and considered the 'Lost Boys of Sudan'. They were first anointed that name from a book, thus more individual stories are still recognizing them as such today.
Their corrupt government wants the entire country to be a total Islamic State, but there are thousands of Sudanese who do not want to convert, abandoning their religions of generations. Therefore, the government has claimed war on these innocent people and continue to carry on with a genocide for those who will not follow Islamic religion/law. (I personally do not have a problem with the Islamic religion. But I do have a problem when any religion is forced upon people.  Especially with such brutality, which is the case in Sudan.)

Various stories of survival of 'The Lost Boys of Sudan' are being published for us, the international community, so we are becoming more instrumental as we can be, with each individuals struggles told. This book is another look at survival in Sudan, for the young boys who run from being either killed or from becoming a soldier and aimlessly having to commit murder, rape and other atrocities--against their own will.
I don't want to give the story away but I will tell you that when one of these young (now men), Salva Dut, eventually is given an opportunity to leave his homeland (in this case) due to war, no chance of education, poverty and all other amenities being stripped of, once he is granted grace and dignity from others, he is rewarded tenfold, by means of giving back to his country.

 A very good book to read if you need some American humble pie, or if you are interested in this subject.  I am of great interest to this subject.  I recommend this book and give it 5 stars.

He has to travel, alone, with no adults to care for him, to a refuge camp.  He has to take a long and treacherous path with a group of people to another refuge camp.  In the camp, there was a list.

He creates stories that not only entertain, they teach about life and how it works. He makes ""bad guy"" characters that are believable and have enough depth that you want to save them.  That being said, as I read some of the other reviews of this series I wondered, Did they even read the same book I read?  Granted most of the characters in this series are great.  Then there is Sadie, the little sister.  At first, her sibling rivalry with her brother and her extreme self-centered behavior were cute - for about 10 pages.  But her self-centered, total self-absorption quickly became both annoying and tiresome.  As an example, even when she thinks her boyfriend is dying, her first thought is how that affects her. All through the book she says, (and I paraphrase) Oh I know that's selfish of me but.....  She never learns and she never takes her attention off how the world revolves around her.  In a world where healthy role-models for young women and girls are difficult to find, I find Sadie disgusting as a main ""good"" character.  She is typical of all the things that are not healthy in a me-me-me society.  I would not want any young woman to think this was a person to emulate. Normally Rick Riordan's bad guys leave you with the belief that there is still something there to redeem.  Here was a supposed good character that had no redeeming qualities.

Adams, Author","When I told my daughters the title of the book, both of them groaned at me.  Why?  Because, kids don't like to clean their rooms.  Sure, parents and caregivers can help kids make a game out of cleaning their rooms, but it usually still takes effort.  Anyway, my kids agreed to listen to the story so we read it as a bedtime story.  We did think the title should be changed to something different to avoid other children not wanting to read the story.
We don't really know many kids who actually like to clean their rooms.
We did like the story, and the illustrations were nice.  The story is about three bunnies who were playing in their bedroom with their toys.  They get bored and want to go outside, even though their mom told them to clean up before she gets home.  They figure they'll have enough time to clean, so they go outside to play.  When the one bunny went back to the bedroom to look for a ball, the story suggests he couldn't believe his eyes with how messy the room was.  This was funny to me because most kids don't really care about the mess and don't even notice the mess.  After the toy train is broken because the room is so messy that the bunny trips and breaks the train, the bunnies clean up the mess.  They make a game of cleaning up, which is a nice way to teach children to make a game of it, but it is unlikely kids would do so without adult encouragement.  Then when the toys are all cleaned up, the bunnies don't want to play anymore because they don't want to make another mess to clean up again.  I had to laugh again because It is unlikely kids would not want to play just because they don't want to clean up. The bunnies decide that they will play, but only play with one thing at a time and put it away before getting another toy out to play with.  Nice idea, but again, it is unlikely children will think of this on their own without adult supervision and encouragement.
Overall, there are great lessons for children to learn in cleaning up their rooms.  However, the way the story is presented, I'm wondering if children will want to re read the story again to reinforce those lessons.  I believe it would still take a lot of encouragement from adults for the lessons to really be learned from this book.  Perhaps if the title were different, and the story focused on the broken toy and the importance of keeping a clean room to prevent broken toys.  Maybe that would have been a better presentation for kids to understand and carry over into their everyday lives as they play.

How do I rate the items I bought?
Every product that I bought starts at 3 Stars and gets subtractions or additions as we go depending on how well it performs according to my expectation and whether the item perform as advertised. In very unusual cases that I have tried or tested some items and cant prove that it did or didn't work, I will likely default to 3 stars just to be neutral. Most important of all, I don't owe a good or bad review to any product or seller; I am here to provide a constructive feedback on the items I bought in order to help you, the reader, to make an informed decision on which product to purchase to satisfy your needs.

Be aware that when I tested a product and it worked well for me, but it failed for you, it does not reflect that my review is inaccurate, it's most likely you have received a defective product, your expectations were too high or it did not perform in a way that you felt was described in the product description. In any of these cases you should get in touch with the seller to rectify the problem as soon as possible.
