We ordered the book pictured here, but received a red book with different illustrations.  If they had shown the picture of the red book, I would not have ordered it.  I was very disappointed.  However, the words of the book are the exact same and it still gets the message across.",3,-0.7535,31,I'm a Big Sister

0061900621,"This book is great for preparing a child for the arrival of a new sibling.  It's perfect for toddlers to essentially teach them WHAT a baby is! I do agree with other reviewers that it would be nice to see nursing referenced rather than bottle feeding, but it's understandable considering when the book was originally published.  I got this for my friend's daughter and I'm going to order another copy for my daughter!",5,0.7983,31,I'm a Big Sister
