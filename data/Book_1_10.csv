My daughter does not like this book at all. I have tried to read it several times and she loses interest immediately. She LOVES books and doesn't lose interest in her favorites. The illustrations are okay, but the ""rhymes"" (if you want to call them that) do not make any sense whatsoever. They are completely nonsensical. If I'm going to read my child a book, I want it to be something she will grow to understand, as that's an important part of reading and comprehension. Another thing I really disliked: The author appears to have overstepped some important boundaries by mentioning mothers and babies kissing ""long and slow."" (And so on.) That just weirded me out. This is not how I kiss my daughter, and I'm sure it's not the way most parents kiss their children. I'd like to think that isn't what the author intended, but it comes off that way and because of that, is inappropriate. My daughter doesn't like this book, I don't like it, and now it's pretty much a book we only flip through once in awhile (without reading). The illustrations are the only redeeming quality.

The author, Ann Whitford Paul, has written a lovely book about goodnight rituals. The little girl wonders how to giraffes saybgoodnight, sloths say goodnight, theyvare so slow, and any animal you can think of. My granddaughter has 3 books read to her, a little talking, then a big hug and kiss goodnight. This is after brushing her teeth and flossing.  It is a wonderful thing to wonder how everyone says goodnight.

Adults will enjoy reading this book to their children. The family can discuss their goodnight rituals, and how it makes them feel. Children will,have many questions. The illustrations by David Walker are bright, vivid and colorful. They depict the rituals and the goodnight times of people and animals. Thus is a lovely book for all to read, and to havebit as part of a goodnight ritual.

She's 5 1/2 and starting kindergarten soon - just like Junie B. She also sometimes forget to use her inside voice and says and does things that get her into trouble. She identifies being a bit afraid of new things, was fascinated by hiding out in the school all alone, and by having friendships that sometimes are a bit fractious. She loved the other chapter about the cute little monkey baby brother.

She enjoys the book very much and is able to practice summarizing the plot and predicting what will happen next - skills she will need as her reading develops. Barbara Park captures the voice and thoughts of a little five-year-old who is beginning to make her own way in school. There are a few pictures but mostly kids have to use their own imagination to follow along. There are many things to identify with.

One criticism is that Park could use fewer expressions like - stupid smelly bus, or big fat Jim. Although that's how kids sometimes talk, it might be better to model better ways of expressing themselves.",She's 5 1/2 and starting kindergarten soon - just like Junie B,1503100800,

Kids with ""good behavior"" (who have already figured out the whole sharing and respect thing) will be left wide eyed and open-mouthed at Junie's antics (they know she's acting inappropriately--but it's so much fun to be the voyer and watch Junie learn her lesson), and kids who have behavior challenges--well, they'll find comfort in a friend like Junie and know they're not alone in trying to make sense of and navigate the differences between ""mine"" and ""mindfulness of others,"" manners, mischief, and maliciousness (Junie never acts in the later intentionally).  And if you've never had a kid like Junie, you've missed out on some awesome (albeit awkward) parenting moments!

This is a series that can promote independence among young readers because of it's easy reading level, but as with anything that your children read and watch, it's a great adventure to share and talk about together.

She finds it incredibly entertaining and has giggle-fits over Junie's antics.  Ms. Park's writing is not on par with other children's classics (like Beverly Cleary or George Selden or E. L. Konisburg), which is why I've only given it four stars.  In comparison to classics, Park's writing is a bit formulaic, the characters are flatter and more stereotypical, and the stories lack depth, but what they lack they fully make up for in comedy.

Junie B is such a fun character.  Barbara Park must enjoy writing her and I think that is conveyed in the stories.  Junie's grammar is atrocious and I've seen several reviews where parents are upset by this.  Folks, have no fear, your kiddos are much smarter than you give them credit for.  If you're worried, simply laugh with your child about how Junie phrases things.

I like that Barbara Park does not shy away from hitting, spitting, and references to shows that Junie has peeked at that are age-inappropriate (for example ""Attack of the Killer Ponies"").  All of it is mild, but such a relief in a literary world that has been so dulled-down as to not give our kids any bad ideas, we've created worlds that just don't resemble reality.  Junie B's world is hyperbolic, but is more real to me--full of mistakes, misunderstandings, some good and bad teaching, and some good and bad parenting--that I think it's a pleasure for me to read as an adult.  I believe children's entertainment should be just that.  Entertaining.  Not a constant barrage of pseudo educational material. There are plenty of lessons to be learned in fiction that is not educational.  Children are fully capable of understanding why Junie's mistakes are mistakes rather than things to be emulated.  Even more important is their appreciation of an author who understands the absurdities of the adult world as seen through children's eyes.",Wonderful Entertainment for the Preschool and Kindergarten Crowd,1422662400,

These are chock-full of bad grammar, words you'd rather not hear a six year old use, attitudes which drive most well-adjusted parents up the nearest wall.

Every page would require such a detour and adjustment to make sure the kid gets the message one wants to deliver. And I don't know about other kids, but at least with my little once you give him a stupid idea (to use a word which shows up repeatedly in this series), it is really darn hard to get him not to act on it at some later time, no matter how much coaching goes with it. These books are filled to the brim with such bad ideas and attitudes. I am dumbfounded that these books are so popular in schools; but I'd  rather have my precious snowflake learn these bad things in school from other kids rather than enable him to be the instigator and *teach* bad behaviors to others in school.

I agree that this is for much older kids (8+) who have a good grasp of right and wrong as well as a fair handle on our language. A book like this will set you back three steps.

What troubles me is that first graders simply aren't like this at all. Even Kindergartener's behave better and don't fuddle the language so much.

The plots do lead to surprise conclusions but getting there is just too painful and, i believe, too damaging for children. I mean, too damaging for my child.

So 3 stars it is.

Here are my issues:

I understand the books are written from the perspective of a kindergartener/first grader, etc., but the grammar and spelling are atrocious. It doesn't help young readers to learn how to spell words properly, when there are so many misspelled. It doesn't help them learn proper grammar either, when the writing contains such poor grammar.

And it certainly doesn't help encourage kind behavior when Junie B. acts like such a flat out brat half the time. She calls other people ""stupid"" and makes fun of them. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for empowering young girls. But this is not empowering. This is being rude.

Honestly? I think the books are terrible. But my daughter thinks they are so incredibly funny that we made a deal: As long as she doesn't start picking up on Junie B.'s behavior (calling other people names, and so on), she can read them. But if she starts acting like Junie B. -- if it's obvious the behavior is stuff she's picking up from the books -- the books are going away.

I don't know how we'll counter the grammar and spelling issues, since she reads the books to herself.

Frankly I wish my daughter had never encountered this book series.

Many people say, these books are inappropriate for children in the target age group, around K through 2nd grade. Many say, they like the Magic Tree House series so much better.

Well, I disagree, and here is why - where MTH is patronising, Junie Jones is light-hearted. Where MTH is in your face with educational content, JJ is subtle. And where MTH simply uses characters of early school age and adorns them with artificial, adult-like behaviours, JJ is observant of the way these kids really are, and respects them as characters of the narrative rather than simply abuse them to get a message across.

So while Junie B. Jones as a character may not always be respectful, these books as such are more respectful of the kids that read them than are the MTH books.

I believe it's because the parents are writing them. If you were to ask a child if they enjoy the books...I feel confident saying that most children would answer an emphatic ""YES!"" The 1 star reviews are given from parents who are concerned about the grammar and Junie's bad manners. Have these ""concerned"" parents ever watched television with their children? (My children don't get to watch most of what is on T.V.) I would recommend these books to any child 1st grade and older. If you are a parent who actually parents then you don't have to worry about your child trying Junie's CRAZY antics.  This is why my children love them so much...the things she does and says is outrageously funny! They wouldn't try the things she does and those are what make the books incredibly funny. As for grammar...I believe the same thing. Your children are learning and I agree that you don't want to ""teach"" bad grammar by letting them read books with bad grammar in them, however, if you are being a parent then when your child says ""I runned"" you correct them...AND...Hopefully, these aren't the only books your child will be reading. They should be getting plenty of opportunities to be learning proper grammar elsewhere. I find it interesting that so many concerned parents are commenting about a ""clean"" children's book when our high school students are reading what the world considers to be ""classics"". I still cannot figure out what the moral to the story ""Of Mice and Men"" actually is. What is the point of making our children read such a sad, twisted, sick book? Not to mention ""Macbeth""...but that is another discussion altogether!

My point is that children need to read books that they love in order to enforce their love of reading. Give them a boring book and what did they learn? Reading is boring! Give them a book that is fun and entertaining and what did they learn? Reading is fun!

A large proportion of the sentences commence with 'And', while the majority of paragraphs contain no more than one sentence each. The writing is choppy in a misguided effort to simplify the language, but the result of having sentence fragment after sentence fragment ends up confusing meaning. Do not use these books for children whose primary language is not English. Do not use them if you want your students of any origin to learn how to write well and read well-crafted prose. The presentation of a book to a child is a serious matter, for as you do it, the child assumes you are presenting something good, of which you and the school approve. They believe that they can safely emulate the kind of writing they read there. Excellent books throng in the market which commit none of the grammatical offenses of the Junie B. Jones books, and yet are funny and light-hearted, with delightful characters. To address a previous reviewer's concerns, I personally do not like the example Junie B. sets in her selfish, rude and cruel behaviours, but it is the murder of the English tongue that I cannot bear. Books of this low standard are why neither Johnnie nor Junie can write.",mistakes beget mistakes,1204934400,

The Junie B series consists of comedic morality tales.  They follow an effective formula yielding a predictable but, on the other hand, accessible narrative arc. Junie B is presented with an issue; responds inappropriately; discovers, with guidance from adults in her life, the error of her ways; gains perspective; and comes to understand the proper way to deal with the issue.

Park's creation draws laughter, astonishment and sympathy because Junie B is a genuine, not ideal, child presented with emotional and ethical challenges that are very real for children her age. In her protagonist, Park effectively blends the traits of impropriety, immaturity, insecurity and innocence. Children can easily identify with Junie B. As a result, the Junie B stories are morality tales that resonate strongly with young readers.

I can certainly see how some young children would find that very appealing, though others might be distressed if they empathize with Junie's classmates.

Before making this series part of your child's reading experience, I suggest that you think about whether your child tends to copy the characters or language from the stories that she reads. If the answer is yes, then save your family from years of therapy, and DO NOT BUY JUNIE B. JONES. Buy Beverly Cleary's Ramona books, Barbara Robinson's Best Christmas Pageant Ever, the Pippi Longstocking series, and even Curious George.

Since the introduction of Junie B. ""Fever"" in my classroom, I have heard the following comments in my room:
-""Stop it.  You're acting like Junie B. Jones"" (said to another student)
-""Miss A, you better close the door for read aloud today if your're reading Junie B. Jones because you're always noisy when you're pretending you're her! [giggle, giggle]""
-""Miss A, you need a vacation!"" (Junie's teacher ""Mrs."" often says this when Junie B. gets crazy - one of my students noticed I was getting a little flustered one day and said it to me!)
Junie B. is hysterical, her antics will leave your children begging for just one more chapter, and laughter will fill your classroom or home.  I do advise against reading ONLY Junie B. Jones books though:  while my children are enjoying checking off each book in the series as we read it from our class list, I INSIST that we (and you) read great literature in between Junie B. books: award winners, non-fiction, poetry, etc.  Barbara Park writes the Junie B. books with horrible grammar, as she is using a kindergartener's point of view, and you don't want that to be your child's only exposure to reading.  On the flip side of that coin though, I also insist that my students ADORE reading, and Barbara Park's Junie B.

The events in the Junie B. Jones series are typical things that young children either directly encounter in their daily lives or fantasize encountering (such as being left behind by a school bus). Some of them may seem mundane to grown-ups, but full of excitement,  suspense and breathless anticipation for young readers. Junie B. Jones is a spirited girl with a unique, creative, and humorous view of the world around her. She may first come across as opinionated (as most 5, 6 year olds are), but one quickly discovers the ""loopholes"" in her opinions. My daughter frequently points out, with a laugh, what Junie B. Jones says wrong or how she mis-interpretes a situation.

This series is a must have for any primary (kindergarten-third grade) classroom.  Junie B. Jones' kindergarten grammar defines her impatient, excited, five year old personality.  I loved reading these books aloud to primary students.  They lend themselves to fast speech, a foot stomp of impatience, and expressive reading for those who enjoy reading aloud.  I would only need to read one Junie B. Jones book to first or second graders, and the rest would jump off of the classroom shelves.  I would have to ask students to take copies out of their desks if I wanted to read another one aloud to the class.  Students don't take Junie B. Jones' personality or misadventures seriously. They are wonderfully wacky and entertaining to a child's mind.  What IS serious is that these books get young students eager to read chapter books.  I have seen many first graders choose Junie B. Jones as their first chapter books.  My students and I loved these books so much that classroom copies became worn, and I am now purchasing new copies for my personal collection.

The book itself was physically bigger than I expected, a little big for a small lap sitting on the potty while trying to potty train, but my two year old isn't quite there yet so it's good for our purposes. The amount of pages was sort of disappointing though, there really aren't very many, but there are a good amount of flaps involved that are strong cardboard. My toddler also loves all the toys in the different scenes, lots of Dinosaurs was a plus!

This is a good book for those kids who understand already why/when they use the potty but maybe still have accidents/are still in pull ups (which that concept is also addressed nicely). However, there isn't much beyond that. I always find photos helpful in these kids of reviews,  so I included some photos of the only potty scenes where basically they only talk about what to do after using the toilet like wipe/flush and wash hands. I felt it was a bit lacking in this area, and due to a shortened story and not many pages is why I docked a star.

To be completely honest, he has never been a huge Elmo fan.  He is, however, a huge fan of books - especially lift the flap books.  We purchased or borrowed several different potty books to see what would interest him.  This became one of his favorites!

This book is about Elmo's younger cousin who is learning how to use the potty.  There's a cousin who is a baby in diapers, the cousin who is potty training, and Elmo (who is already potty trained).  I think this is an excellent book if you have an older sibling who already uses the potty.  Elmo plays the big sibling role in this book, and it's a great correlation.

Each page has tons of flaps to lift.  That was my son's favorite part by far.  His older sister enjoyed this book as well, so they'd sit together and read.

I have to personally disagree with the reviewer who said it was too difficult for young readers.  I think it absolutely depends on the kid.  This is definitely a story, not a simple 3-words-per-page board book.  Those simple board books never seemed to work for us with potty training.  They didn't keep him sitting long enough!  If you can read it in 30 seconds, he's not getting a great chance on the potty!

At some point as parents we're willing to try anything to make potty training successful.  I wouldn't go so far as to say this is the reason we had success, but it's definitely a book he enjoys.

It doesn't talk as much about using the potty as I thought it would, but one page does give a description of the sequence of steps to follow when going to the bathroom. The story line is Elmo's two cousins come to his house. One is a baby still in diapers, the other is in training pants learning to use the child's potty. On one page Elmo tells his cousin Albie how to use the potty (wipe, flush, wash hands). Albie chooses not to go and then has an accident later when they are playing. Elmo's mother tells Albie that Elmo had accidents, too. Then Albie uses his potty. My child loves the flip ups, although many of them are very small and harder to lift if a child's fine motor skills aren't good. A couple of the flip up pages don't even change. On most flaps, there is a new picture. Example: You lift up the cover on the toy box and see the toys inside. However, one example is a lamp; you flip up the flap and it is just another picture of the lamp.

So oversll, I'm happy I got this book even though I still think it's not the most helpful potty training aid.

Original review: I was a bit disappointed in this book. We are potty training our 14 month old, and this book seems to be fit for older toddlers. The flaps are very dainty and too small. The story is not as engaging as some other potty-training books. Our toddler likes Elmo a lot, but she is not very interested in this book. Elmo uses the toilet, not the potty.

Soothing & rhyming..  Delightful details and lively scenes.  this stunning book makes a great baby shower gift.  retro -- nostalgic -- sweet style.

I came across this book, but hesitated for a minute to purchase it because I feel uncomfortable buying books sight unseen (especially if they're a gift). The positive reviews for this book finally convinced me, and I was not disappointed!

This book is simply gorgeous. The message is simple, and one I believe any parent (or grandparent, or really any other family member) would understand and want to share with their children: ""No matter what you choose to do or who you choose to be, I will always love you."" It is a beautiful message about unconditional love. Paired with beautiful and whimsical illustrations of children expressing their creativity, this book is touching without being ridiculous or too cutesy.

While this book doesn't contain a ""story"" that would excite a young child and keep them captivated, I still think it is a great book to read together with your child, simply for its beautiful message. It's a message every child should frequently hear. In fact, I love this book so much I'm about to order a copy for my own children!",Simply beautiful,1510358400,

Every evening and most rainy days, my two youngest children and I cuddle up on the couch and together we read stories.  Our collection is ever growing and I am always delighted to find a book that I am genuinely excited to add to our shelf.  Their current ages are three and five so we spend a great deal of time enjoying picture books.  We received our copy of The Wonderful Things You Will Be by Emily Winfield Martin as a birthday gift.  This quickly became our favorite picture book and here is why.

Illustrations:
Before even beginning the story, I fell in love with the whimsical illustrations.  The pictures are so unique, soft, precious and warm.  I found myself so captivated by the magical images on each page that I paused long after the words were read to absorb the beauty and detail. The children in the story are drawn with such care and each one is so individual and incredible.  Its  almost too wonderful to keep on the bookshelf and deserves to be framed and hung on the wall.

Originality:
As I said before, we spend a significant amount of time reading in our family and its always a treat to find something completely new and original to add to our collection.  Emily Winfield Martin has blessed us with just that.  The Wonderful Things You Will Be stands out in a category of its own by combining outstanding, one of a kind artistic beauty with an encouraging and heartwarming message.  There isn't another book on our shelf that compares.  Her style is truly her own and greets readers with an individual experience they will want to reread over and over again.

Message:
The message of the tale is in the voice of a parent to their child.  It starts with the parent wondering aloud about who their young child will grow up to be.  From the very beginning, it portrays a strong message that, as a parent, they are certain that their child is someone they want to know.  Other childrens books do a great job of reassuring love between a parent and child but this adds another beautiful element to that message. Not only does it affirm that the parent will love the child, whoever they grow up to be, but it puts a great deal of excitement on all of the possible ways they can become their very own person.  It encourages adventure, taking care of others, individuality, wholesome character traits and creativity.  It says to go be everything you were created to be and I will love you with wonder and admiration.  What a powerful and uplifting message to children of any age.  Heck, what a powerful message for adults!

Story Flow:
When reading aloud, it is always enjoyable to be able to read a story with a steady, easy to follow flow.  This story is laid out in a comfortable progression of rhyming phrases without being sing-songy.  Each page contains a small amount of script while the captivating illustrations tell the story right along with the the written word.  The language is vivid, fun and adds character and creativity to this wonderful story.

It Doesnt Get Old:  I like Dr. Suess and admire his work, however, I can only read the tongue twisting silliness so many times before my head starts spinning.  How refreshing to have a story that you and your children can enjoy over and over again.  My kids have their favorite stories to listen to that aren't always my favorites to read repeatedly.  Its a blessing to have this book as a family favorite.  Each time I turn the page the kids point to the children in the illustrations and pick which one they want to be.  Its an easy choice and enjoyable for all us.

The Wonderful Things You Will Be has become my go to baby shower gift.  The last mom-to-be I gifted it to admitted to crying the first time she read it.  Perhaps it was just the hormones, but I venture to say that she truly appreciated the beauty and sincerity of this wonderful book.  Your family library is not complete without this gem.  This is a story book I cherish and long to share with every other child I hold dear.",Reading books to my children is my absolute favorite part of our day,1505952000,

She had not read it in person, but purchased based upon the thousands of reviews giving five stars. While I appreciate the gesture, I don't believe she would have selected it had she read it in person, and it is not a book I want to keep for my children (as my one year old also has a three year old sister, also interested in any books we read together). As many others have stated, in the first place, this book is problematic because it has easily tearable pages--not ideal for a young toddler, such as my one year old. For example, I can't return the book now, because she accidentally ripped the cover within minutes of opening the book. However, the words content to lend themselves to a younger audience, birth to aged 3 or 4 at most, and would be better as a board book for that reason. In general, the content provides the same generic ""I love you so much"" content as many other books, many of which are better because they are more simple and concrete/specific. I LOVE the whimsical and vintage-y style of the illustrations, however I felt there was some unappreciated subtle messaging present about gender. I also thought the following lines were a bit dark for a young audience: ""When nights are black and When days are gray -- You'll be brave and be bright So no shadows can stay."" And finally, I thought it was odd that the line ""And become anybody That you'd like to be"" opens up to pages of children in party costumes (animals, a tree, a moon, fairytale characters)... I know I could be WAY over-analyzing here, but if there's one thing I dislike about my millennial generation, it's the way so many of us ""put on a mask"" via social media to present how we'd like to be seen, rather than being genuinely who we are. I am ALL for kids growing up to be ANYTHING or anyone they want to be, but why weren't these pages illustrated with kids dressing up in clothing representing careers (scientist, mathematician, author, politician, teacher, etc) or representing more characteristics (kind, honest, generous, compassionate--perhaps because that would be redundant after the rest of the book?)?  This book almost feels like... a mishmash of random, beautiful illustrations that the author couldn't quite assemble into a coherent book. In some ways, it is very much like ""Oh the Places You'll Go"" by Dr. Seuss, but written unsuccessfully for a toddler audience.",BEFORE YOU BUY AS A GIFT...,1501459200,

Sometimes, I feel a little fearful when I think of how children can't help but be exposed to the negative influences in the world at much younger ages than ever before, no matter how much we try to protect them.  At the same time, there are so many BEAUTIFUL and good influences in the world as well, like this book, and I truly believe that keeping a steady diet of healthy, positive ""mind food"" going into a youngster's brain can go a long way in equipping them to counteract the junk that creeps in from time to time.

This precious book is such a great tool to help them begin... soft illustrations complementing simple words, a book that encourages a youngster to use his/her imagination and think of all of the possibilities in answering the age old question adults pose to them, ""So... what do you want to be when you grow up?""  There are SO many things I like about it.  Many of the children's books we've accumulated over the years for our grandchildren go into possible occupations - but life is so much more than occupations, isn't it?  ""Who"" you become is so much more than that, and the pages reflect that sentiment with deeper questions, one of my favorites being, ""Will you tell a story that only you know?""

You'll find that so many of the pages contain encouraging and supportive statements of belief in a child's capabilities, i.e. ""I know you'll be..."" (kind/clever/bold/brave/bright), with the last page assuring him/her ""And I'll love you, whoever you've grown up to be.""  I really believe books like this can be so instrumental in promoting a good self-image, as a child's rapidly developing mind soaks in positive messages.  Think youngsters will especially enjoy a 2-page spread toward the back that has flaps opening up into a full 4-page spread, with children dressed in various Halloweenish-looking costumes (isn't that what they're actually doing while they're tricking-or-treating... an early testing out imaginative possibilities?), and the diversity of the children depicted is a nice plus.

I doubt there's a parent or grandparent out there who hasn't gazed at the face of a newborn cradled in their arms and not dreamed of ""the wonderful things you will be""?  At our Christmas gathering this year, it was so terrific for my husband and I to look at all of those beautiful little faces and think about the wonderful things they will all be!  This was one of the gifts for our 2+ year old grandson, but I know his two older brothers will enjoy it as well, along with his baby sister one day.",Such a poignant book - brought a catch in my throat and a joyful tear to my eye!,1482105600,

On the other hand, the content of the book itself is not that great. I decided upon five stars for the illustrations and three stars for the writing, averaging my rating out to four stars.

This book is basically about a parent looking at his/her child and wondering what the child will grow up to be. It is written in a rhyme, which I like and appeals to my four-year-old daughter, but the writing is too simplistic and not very exciting at all. I mostly bought this book based off of the illustration on the cover and the ones on the preview of the book and I was not disappointed in that regard. The illustrations are whimsical and darling. My daughter loves looking at the pictures and they always bring up questions about what the children are doing, so the book, though lacking in written content, allows us to have good conversations.

Note: If you bought this book and didn't like the content or if you're planning to buy this book based mostly on the illustrations, I want to tell you not to give up on the author (Emily Winfield Martin) because she can and has done better. I also purchased her book called ""Dream Animals"" and the content is much better (wonderful, really) and the illustrations are even much better than the ones in this book, so please don't give up on her until you have seen and read that book.

Regardless of age, we all benefit from regular infusions of this idea: that each of us is unique, has purpose and deserves love. I assert that both reader and listener will enjoy reading and rereading this book, time after time. And every time, they will experience a thrum of warmth. Five Stars!

Adoption-attuned (AQ*) Lens This book is a wonderful stepping stone to conversations. It can both explore the childs dreams and discuss the historical patterns in the familyadoptive as well as biological. This affirms the childs fundamental right to bloom into the person potentiated by both nature and nurture. Such a conversation reassures children that they have permission to follow their North Star and relieves them of the notion that they must become their parents fantasy child.

The Wonderful Things You Will Be not only show cases what I love about Emily's artwork, it also captures the joy, the innocence and the marvel of a child's world. To match it's beautiful illustrations, this picture book also has an equally beautiful, moving message that children can be anything they'd like to be, and can go anywhere they'd like to go. I love this book's message. As a mother that's one of the best messages that we can teach to our children. The Wonderful Things You Will Be is simply lovely. It's one of those books that belongs in every baby nursery, and on the bookshelf in every child's room.",Simply Lovely!,1453680000,

The Wonderful Things You Will Be (2015) by Emily Winfield Martin is the rare picture book that truly has something for everyone. This thoughtful, quiet story imagines all of the things little ones (both babies and bigger kids) will grow up to be including creative and clever as well as brave and bold.

Martin's rhyming text moves the narrative along with lyrical narration reminiscent of a poem or a lullaby. Although this book is an obvious choice for parents to read with their children, it can also work just as well in a story time program. The text is just a tad too long for a baby story time but I could see toddlers or school age children being drawn in by the bright colors and rhymes.

This picture book also add just the right touch of whimsy with subtle touches including children dressed as animals and other fantastical aspirations. Each page has ample white space for text combined with bright, colorful illustrations. The Wonderful Things You Will Be includes children from a variety of backgrounds as well as boys and girls. It also thoughtfully circumvents many gendered or cultural stereotypes to create sensitive depictions of each child.

The Wonderful Things You Will Be is a subtle, charming picture book sure to appeal to readers of all ages. A joy to read.","a subtle, charming picture book",1447113600,

Great rhyming and pace -- good sense of humor

Fun book
The naked baby's front parts are never shown (bare butt is) so gender neutral.
Would make a lovely gift.

Good luck to all with the POTTY training.
Some other good ideas are stickers as rewards and special undies that the child wants to try to wear.

It's actually the first activity a child learns that only he/she can do that no one else can do FOR them!  Have to admit that I can't recall going through the training process with my own sons - it was just TOO long ago! - but I was babysitting our oldest grandson fulltime when he was going through it so it's fresh in my mind, and I will never forget the first time he succeeded in pooping.  His eyes widened at that little ""plop"" sound, and I exclaimed ""AIDEN!  I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!!!"", to which he replied, ""I'M SO PROUD OF YOU TOO, GRANDMA!""  Sometimes you just want to wrap yourself up in their cuteness, don't you?

I missed out - oh darn ;-) - on most of the process with our middle grandson since my daughter-in-law became a stay-at-home mom as he was almost ready to begin, and now it's coming time for the youngest grandson to start.  I truly love everything about this darling little board book - not only the cute illustrations (author/illustrator Leslie Patricelli does such a super job capturing the baby's expressions!), VERY simple words that a 2 year old can relate to, and the nice thick pages on this 7"" x 7"" book (perfect for a youngster to hold while waiting for something to happen on the pot), but ALSO how terrifically it reflects the growing awareness a child must have before he/she is ready to begin the process.  Being able in his/her mind to connect the physical sensation with how to respond, decide what he/she wants to do (go in the diaper or on the potty?), get there, take the diaper off, sit and stay there long enough to finish - for a youngster, that requires a LOT of memory/concentration, and being able to combine physical/cognitive skills.  The final pages do a super job of positive reinforcement - from his own sense of accomplishment, to his parents praise, to the reward at the end... ""UNDIES!""

It's so sad to think that - according to the American Academy of Pediatrics - more abuse occurs during toilet training than at an other stage of development, with parents'/caretakers' expectations sometimes exceeding a child's abilities/understanding, mistaking a child's imperfect attempts for acts of willful disobedience.  Wow - when you talk about early opportunities to BUILD a child's self-esteem, to REWARD each progressive positive step, to cement the bonds of trust between child/parent by treating relapses as not a failure, but part of the learning process, just as with any skill we develop!  Not all kids are ready at the same time, and trying to force it too early is going to backfire in terms of stressing a child out and prolonging the process.  Yes, it's a stressful (and usually messy!) period, but positive reinforcement and patience - whether you're a child or an adult - always gets better results than negative reinforcement and exhibited/sensed frustration.  This is such a simple yet excellent little book to give to some little person in your life to help ""psyche themselves up"" for independently managing one of their daily bodily functions!","Here's a positive & cute little tool to use in prepping a youngster for taking the big step!

I wanted to get a few books that would be fun tools to help teach them how to use the potty and this book seemed very popular with good reviews, so we ordered it along with a few others.

Potty is a short story with few words about a young toddler who wonders if he or she should go to the potty in a diaper or in the potty. The tiny human thinks about how cats and dogs go to the bathroom and if using the potty is the right thing to do. The pictures are pretty cute and my twins, who are now three-and-a-half, still enjoy looking at the pictures. This book measures 7 inches by 7 inches, has 28 pages and is a board book with thick pages so it's very durable in case your kids are still in the very destructive stage! The little person is also gender neutral so this book would be good for boys or girls.

This book is very cute but, if you decide to purchase it, you will probably need to do a lot of explaining as to what is going on in each picture. That doesn't bother me too much but some people may prefer books that have more words and tell a story.

This book would probably be more appropriate for children in the one to two year age group but older children might not find it interesting. My kids still like to look at the pictures but we don't use it much anymore although we read it a lot when we got it last year.

I initially flipped through it and wasn't all the impress. But after a few weeks of reading it a few times a day (when my son is on the potty) I can definitely say that it's awesome.

This is the most simple out of all of our potty training books. Each page has a sentence, phrase or jus pictures. We use a lot of voice infliction and funny faces when we read it and my son laughs so hard. The page where the little baby has to go and is making sounds ""oooh"" ""mmmm"" ""haaa"" ""eeee"" is hilarious when read with fun sounds and inflictions. My son loves the comic strip looking page. We narrate it ourselves. The faces on the baby are hilarious. Then when baby thinks ""What's that?"" and gets big eyes we make a big production about it. He's nearly fallen off the toilet laughing.

The fact that it's so short makes me not dread reading it, like a couple others we have. The humor we find in it makes it special. My son has about 4 potty books in a basket next to the toilet.

My little guy was on the late end of adopting toilet training (close to 34 months when he finally got around to it) at home. He was fine at daycare. We couldn't figure out why.

Turns out he needed a little incentive to stay put and a new strategy (child's toilet seat vs. a training potty). The two of them came together. We brought out 'Potty.'

The story is simple, breaking down the varying aspects of using the potty into short statements paired with illustrations on each page. In fact, it's not much of a ""story"" but rather a listing of the sequential steps (""i have to pee  should i use my diaper  i can use the potty  waiting for the pee to happen  tinkle, tinkle toot (a favorite page in the book) etc.)  which may not seem as sophisticated to an adult, but for a toddler this seems to be exactly the right developmental level to break down the process into buzzwords and statements, rather than elaborate sentences. This is one of those children's books that I didn't quite click with right away, but after my toddler kept pulling it out time after time, I started to appreciate the simple effectiveness of this storytelling approach.

Especially during the more challenging potty training moments, when my toddler would refuse to look at other potty training books entirely, she still got a laugh out of this one, so I would say this book was a great tool in keeping my toddler interested in potty training by making it more fun.","Great, developmentally appropriate book for the aspiring potty-using toddler",1459987200,

- A gender-less baby character (12 months to 24 months max)
- Child using a toddler potty (not the regular toilet)
- A naked baby with privates cleverly covered; one image of a bare butt (see pic)
- A dog and cat going potty outside and in cat box
- No actual poop or pee
- Baby running with toilet paper in celebration at the end (see pic)

The story, in a nutshell [I say he, but baby could easily be a girl]:
Baby has to go potty and wonders where he should go (in diaper or somewhere else). He asks where the animals go to the potty and sees where. He decides to try going on his toddler potty. You see a sequence of the steps (remove diaper, sit, read book, wait, wait more) before he succeeds (""Tinkle, tinkle, toot... I did it!""). He celebrates with his parents. Last page spread just depicts all kinds of underwear, presumably to help your little one can get excited about wearing them (boy and girl styles shown).

Verdict:
The book is adorable and I love the art. This book has short, simple sentences and clearly target the younger potty training crowd (definitely for under 2, though older toddlers may still enjoy). I'll working on potty training soon (hopefully around 18 months) so I really appreciate a young character. I don't see my son relating as well to preschool age book characters. We are reading this now, ahead of time to familiarize him with the concepts and he loves this one. I wish the baby in the book asked where his parents go potty and not just the pets. Though parents are easier to make a direct relation to, the plot does allow conversations about everyone/thing having a place where they go potty, and baby's place is on the little potty. Since we have dogs, that may help.

I'll be reviewing every potty training book I can get my hands on in the near future as I find the ones I like best so stay tuned!

So we had to get over that . We have several other pottyfir boys books and the boys in the other books definitely look grown.
The others he did not relate to at all and would most if thr time not want me to read those books. This one was simple direct and all about his fears and anxiety with a little humor abd great praise. I feel like it was a huge oart if our success.  We are 100 percent trained in just 3 days and its been a week now and we are on our first trip away since starting.",This is the book that will work for you.,1458950400,

He is sitting on the potty, and then he tinkles and toots, and then he is doing the happy dance with his parents, great...but in our case we need to SEE it.  Seriously.  I am going back to Alona Frankel's book which I used for my others kids.  In that one you SEE the poop in his diaper, on the floor and in the potty and it is more of a story (because isn't that how it goes??).  Don't get me wrong, my son really likes this book, and he picks it up to read all the time, he also pees like a champ....but I need a book that shows him poop in the toilet.

We never wanted to make potty time something intimidating but we both felt that we'd reached the end of our ability to keep the stress factor low.

Potty, by Leslie Patricelli, came recommended by a family friend with a few kids of her own. Honestly, I was a little skeptical that a book would do much. My son has hordes of other books that he loves and I figured this would just be added to the pile. Well, this book isn't a panacea for you potty-training angst. But it is such a fun, cute little book that my son adores. We read this book probably 5 or more times a day and he cracks up every time. We've even convinced him (with the help of this book, of course) that it'd be more fun to read the book on the toilet!

The book is short, very colorful, and extremely easy to read. My son adores this book and reads along (as much as he can).

For example on the page when the child is on the potty and is very sleepy there are no words so I tell my son ""We even use the potty at night when we are sleepy""  or on the page where the cat is using the little box and page where the dog is peeing on the tree all it says is ""oh"" on those pages, so instead we say ""Cats go poop in the litter box"" and ""Dogs go poop outside"".

The author knows kids and has created a book with images and dialogue at a very appropriate level for their understanding.  I can tell you though when it arrived and I read it myself I thought Amazon had led me astray.  However the first time I read it to my toddler I noted weird lights going on in his head.  I saw them.  He was very interested in this book immediately although I found the story ridiculous.  Like other reviewers I thought what does a cat peeing in a litter box have to do with him potty training?  We kept the book next to his potty and anytime he would sit there, even underwear on I would read it to him.  He loved it.  Prepare yourself people to read this horrible yet effective text over and over.  This book helped him slow down and wait and created a consistent dialogue for us to use as parents.  He potty trained with this book just before he turned 2 years old.  Has consistently stayed dry since about 26months.  There is no one answer for potty training as all kids are different.  For us this book absolutely worked to help him develop the patience he needed to wait for business to happen.  The reason I remembered to leave this review almost a full year later is because he and my husband were reading the book together at bedtime last night.  He still likes this boring story!  Be warned.  You will read it again and again.","Tinkle, Tinkle, Tooooooot!",1427587200,

1. The kid seems stressed out and alarmed most of the book--do you really want to reinforce that this is stressful and uncomfortable?  I understand validating a toddler's feelings but why potentially feed their fears?
2. They equate going potty with a cat and a dog, but they don't show an adult, which would be the most logical.  Is showing a cat going in a litter box and dog going outside really relevant?  Are we trying to teach our kids to go in a box or outside?  Just weird as a parallel.
3. They never say what they need to do.  Does the author think it's not relevant?  Uncouth?  We're talking about this at home--it is exactly what should be in the book.

""Potty"" details the dilemma of an adorable round-headed youngster who during the first eight pages of this 14 page book thinks about whether or not to wet a diaper.  Kinda cute & Hamlet-like!  In the last pages, the child sits and sits and sits, a paragon of patience as the cat and dog fall asleep.  Then!  There's a ""Tinkle, tinkle, toot"" and great is the joy.

 ""Potty"" is a board book toddlers can hold themselves; the child is drawn cartoon-style with only a few words or no words on each page in primary colors but with such an expressive face, who needs a lot of words.  It is relatively inexpensive even new and there's a wild sense of humor that may appeal (""What does kitty do?"")'

But this book just exceeds my expectation. Its drawing is so simple--almost abstract--that I was initially afraid that my 18-month daughter who typically likes photographic books wouldn't be interested in it. Obviously, I was wrong; there is something special about Leslie Patricelli's drawing. Even before she was introduced to an actual potty chair, my daughter was intrigued by the eyes-wide-opening baby on the page where s/he (gender neutral) finally ""did it."" She always pointed to that image with an ""ah"" when she flips through the pages. Then we bought a potty chair for her. My daughter didn't know what to do with it in the first place--she even tried to put her feet in the potty as her grandma does with a foot basin. But she immediately learned to sit on it for a reasonable length of time once I brought her this book.

Although I didn't use this book in the real sense of potty training--it is way too premature for my daughter to start the process, I'm pleased that it introduced the potty concept very nicely to a 18-month old. Now my daughter asks to read this book every time she sits on the potty. Or the other way around, she will sit on the potty every time I bring to her the book--I do this when I see signs of her bowel movement.

The only caveat, if one insists, is that my daughter picked up the habit of getting up to fetch another book to read when she is on the potty, because the baby in the book gets up to grab a book before s/he settles down. Not sure if all parents like this habit. For me, if that is the worst thing to happen during potty training, I won't complain.",18-month daughter loves this book and learned the potty concept,1401148800,

I didn't expect it to be an in-depth how-to for my toddler, though apparently some reviewers did. I expected what I got: a very simple book to amuse my child about a topic we've been talking about.
This book is now kept in the car, as it's one of his favorites to look at during short car trips around town. We have many books for him, ranging from picture books to full stories, and his dad reads to him nearly every night as their part of the bedtime routine.

5.0,,True,"06 15, 2013",A3K0LATK2OE49G,0763644765,{'Format:': ' Board book'},Kristen,"This book is about a little kid who realizes he needs to pee.  He considers what animals do (kitty uses a litter box, while doggy pees in the yard), and debates what he should do himself. Should he go in his diaper, as he has in the past?  Or should he try to use the potty this time?  He decides to give it a go on the potty.  After sitting patiently for a long time, he is finally successful.  His mommy and daddy are excited, and presumably they live happily ever after, etc.

As a parent, I liked that this is a very child-centered book.  It is not about parents trying to potty-train a child.  It is about a child making deciding for himself that he would like to use the potty, working through the idea, giving it a try, struggling, and ultimately succeeding.  The parents are only shown at the very end of the book, celebrating the child's success.

This book is simple, colorful, and fun.  It addresses many concerns relevant to a child, including:
-Deciding whether to use diapers vs. potty
-Boredom associated with sitting on the potty while waiting for the pee or poop to come out.
-Humor.  The child initially sits down on the potty with his diaper still on, then remembers to take it off.  A toddler who has been introduced to how the potty works will be amused by this rookie mistake.
-More humor.  The child dozes off on the potty, only to be awakened by the noises ""Tinkle, tinkle, TOOT!"" as his pee and poop comes out.  If you are 2 years old, this is hysterical.
-The eventual milestone of getting to wear big-kid underpants

RECOMMENDED AGE RANGE: 1-2 years. Due to it's simplicity and the baby-like appearance of the protagonist, this is great book for younger potty-trainers.  For a child who is late to training (age 3), other books like Joanna Cole's ""My Big Boy Potty"" / ""My Big Girl Potty"" would be more appropriate.","Positive, child-centered book for little kids who are considering the potty",1371254400,

We've had it for about two weeks. It sits on a stand right next to her Baby Bjorn potty chair (which she has already successfully used twice!). She sits on her chair and reads this book several times per day. She loves it!

Some things about this book:
The pictures are very simple, so they aren't overstimulating.
The child in the book is gender neutral. The author also doesn't use the words ""she"", ""he"", ""boy"", ""girl"". The story is written from the child's point of view, and the child always says ""I"". This makes it very nice if you have multiple children to potty train or plan on keeping the book for multiple children.
The sentences are all short and to the point, perfect for toddlers to understand.
This book doesn't use the words ""poop"", ""pee"", or anything like that. That makes it easy to teach your child the words you want him/her to say regarding bodily functions.
I love the final page of the book. The are tons of drawings of ""undies"" (the author's word) in boy and girl styles. We already bought our daughter some ""big girl undies"" (one pair sits with the book to help reinforce the picture).
There is just enough humor to keep the book from being too serious, but not so much that it makes the book completely comical.
This book will not potty train your child (that's your job), but it will help reinforce what you are trying to teach. Not to mention, it gives you both something fun to do while you are waiting.
This is one of those books that I don't mind reading to my daughter hundreds of times. It's easy to add some of your own dialogue to the book. That keeps it from getting boring, since I try to change it up every time I read it.",Perfect!,1353110400,

Some of her books are great, and others I think are really stupid (ie ""Higher Higher""). At first this book fell into the latter category and I did not like it at all. It seemed way too watered down and simple with too many ""vague"" pages (like a two-page spread of the baby holding himself going ""Eeee, Mmm, Ahh, Ooo"") and not enough explanation about what is happening (example: no mention of the words `pee' or `poo' or any other words of the sort aside from ""potty"" which most babies are associating with the toilet seat themselves, yet there are FOUR pages on ""Where does kitty go? [turn page] Oh. Where does doggy go?..."" with simply a picture of the cat by itself and then the cat standing in a [liter] box. I mean, really? You have to come to so many conclusions on your own on so many pages, a toddler under two is not able to draw those when these are first time experiences). Anyway, sure enough, my little one (maybe 15 months at the time) didn't like it either at first. He became bored instantly. So I had plans to return it, but because I put it out of sight, it fell out of mind very quickly. So after finally printing the return packing slip and putting it in a box a couple months later, I thought I'd give it another whirl before shipping it off, and whaddayaknow, the tot loves it now! (17 months). And of course his favorite page?... the two page spread of the baby holding himself going ""Eeee, Mmm, Ahh, Ooo"". And now I just improvise with the words and take the liberties of adding my own explanations where one is lacking (the whole book) (final pages: baby sitting on potty trying, waiting, turn page, waiting, bored, asleep, turn page, perks up ""what's that?"", turn page, *tinkle tinkle toot* ""I did it!"" turn page, *undies*!)...weird.

One thing that we really enjoyed to do was while she was trying, we'd count the undies at the end of the book.

We first checked it out from our local library on a whim, but my daughter (almost two) liked it so much that we went ahead and bought it.  Besides the fact that my daughter likes it so much, I love this book for the following reasons:

1. It shows just the right amount
Some potty books just go too far in how much of the body they show and it's just awkward to me.  Then there are other potty books on the other end of the spectrum that have kids wearing underwear while they're sitting on the potty.  Not helpful when you're trying to teach a little one how to use the potty.  This book shows just enough to be helpful and instructive, but there are no awkward moments in pointing things out on the little kid in the book.  And because it doesn't show any private parts, it's great both boys and girls!

2. The story is funny and true to life
Both my daughter and I love all the funny faces the kid in the book makes.  She'll copy the faces all the time and it cracks us up.  She also thinks it's funny when the kid forgets to take off his diaper before he sits on the potty.  I think, even though it's just something silly, it's also something she can really relate to and understand.

3. The artwork is charming
The illustrations are simply charming.  They have lots of great color and they're easy for my daughter to understand.

4. It's really engaging
We've checked out several potty books from the library for my daughter who's almost two.  She's shown interest in a lot of the books, but not for as long or as much as this book.  It's truly made her excited to use the potty and wear panties.  Half the time I think she just wants to try and go on the potty so she can read this book.

Only a toddler knows when the time is right, but when the time gets close Potty will be there to encourage our young future potty users along. Go along with Baby as he discovers what it means to go on the potty instead of outside like a dog or in a litter box like a kitty, but on the potty like a big kid. From potty time with book in hand and kitty and doggie napping at his feet all the way to Baby's first pair of underpants. Show your toddler just what it means to lose the diaper and make time for the potty.

You name it, we've tried it. Two different potty's, treats, cheerios, m & m's, stickers, many many books, and more. Nearly every trick you can think of to get our dear sweet Turkeybird onto the potty and out of the diaper, but no way. That is, until his little sister picked up this book and took matters into her own hands. Littlebug adores this book, and so do I.

In classic Leslie Patricelli form with bold illustrations and a funny story kiddos are introduced to a new world of possibility on their terms. Which is exactly what Littlebug loves about this book. She's recently been on a `me do it!' kick. No more mom stepping in to help with anything, she wants to do it all herself. And I'm actually torn by this. In some ways it's a bit more difficult and takes more time, but in a few weeks I know our world will be completely different and quite possibly much better. And the best thing about all of this is that big brother has taken note and doesn't want to be left behind. So, I'm currently the momma of two potty-training toddlers. Crazy! I blame much of that on this extremely fantastic book!

With bright colors, a cute character and a very funny story little ones learn that there is a better way than pooping in a diaper. There's the Potty! Not only, no more diapers, but big kid underpants with all sorts of fun pictures on them. This is the perfect book for toddlers and even those tough-to-train kiddos. By showing what can sometimes be a whole lot of waiting, but a very `big kid' thing to do, toddlers soon realize this may be something worth trying out. Without a doubt this would be my first recommendation when it comes to potty training books for kiddos. A fun story with a great way to teach little ones basics!

GOODNIGHT (GGCS) is a great readaloud, as I'm sure you already know. The book is perfect for those kids that like construction equipment and things-that-go. In this book the guys are finishing up after a hard days work. The Crane and the Cement Mixer, for example, are shown wrapping up the day and settling down.

Besides being a good Goodnight Read, I like that this book uses good rhyming and that it gives me and other parents a chance to name the various machines and describe what they do. Besides the two named above the book includes Excavator, Bulldozer, and Dump truck.

Highly recommend. GOODNIGHT, GOODNIGHT, CONSTRUCTION SITE has a lot going for it.
--Good word play/rhymes that make for a good readaloud.
--Soften artwork which is as restful as the text.

First, when I sat down to read this book with my son, I found that it had two pairs of pages still bound together at the top right corner.  I did not want to get up and get a knife to properly cut the pages apart, so I tried to separate them with my hands and ended up tearing one of the pages a little.  Oh well, my fault for being a little lazy, but still a slight quality issue.

Second, and this is mostly the reason for my one-star deduction, I feel that the story could have been better organized so that you would not have to go back and forth between day and night as each truck is discussed.  It seems to me that the story could have remained in the day for each truck, then in the late afternoon for each truck, and then in the evening for each truck.

When this book was published in 2011, I babysat full time for our oldest grandson while my daughter-in-law was in the work force, he was 3 years old and was HEAVY into Thomas the train.  We'd begun a collection of diecast trains for him, along with the Island of Sodor's construction team (called ""The Pack""), and each and EVERY day at naptime he would have to say ""goodnight"" to each and every one of them individually - this darling book does exactly that, saying an individual goodnight to the rough and tough crane, cement mixer, dump truck, bulldozer and excavator, who are all calming down and getting ready to call it a night (with all of the typical bedtime rituals included in the book - taking a bath, getting tucked in, curling/snuggling up, dimming the lights and shutting the door) - it would have been absolutely PERFECT!

We've added a couple of more grandsons since then, and though Mommy is now a full-time mom and I no longer get to partake in all of the traditional naptime rituals with our 4 or 2 year old grandsons (big brother's a 3rd grader already!), I went ahead and bought this for the youngest's 2nd birthday.  Whether it's naptime or bedtime, the calming way this book is written coupled with the cute illustrations of the vehicles yawning, shutting their eyes, etc., is bound to be a sure-fire winner for any parent or grandparent tasked with helping a youngster to ""Turn off your engines, stop your tracks, relax your wheels, your stacks, and backs.  No more huffing and puffing, Team:  It's time to rest your heads and dream.  Construction site, all tucked in tight, the day is done, turn off the light.  Great work today!  Now... shh... goodnight.""  Even ""tough"" kids need their rest too!

Especially if read in a quiet, soothing tone, I can't think of a more perfect bedtime book.  You know how seeing someone yawn usually makes you yawn yourself?  I think that's the exact effect the illustrations will have... I'm just envious of my son and daughter-in-law for getting to be the ones to read it to him!  (And if I raised my son right, he'll be reading this to my first grandDAUGHTER who's arriving in October in just a couple of years as well!)","Oh why, oh WHY didn't I find out about this book sooner?!",1471910400,

He will drop everything to come over for some reading time if I pull it out! The pictures are incredible and the prose is concise, simple, yet not 'dumbed down' -- and in an easy rhyme that holds my toddler's attention. A must-have for anyone whose child is really into construction vehicles!

The ONLY downside, as another reviewer has noted, is that all of the characters in this book are male. I find this problematic as I don't want my son growing up thinking that there are 'boy things' and 'girl things.' I don't see why construction vehicles and this book can't be appealing to both genders! To address this, when I read aloud to him I substitute 'she/her' instead of 'he/his' for alternate characters. Which is great, until he gets old enough to read for himself. To be fair, this highly gendered subject material is not just an issue for this book specifically, but for most children's books that deal with traditionally 'boys only' subjects in general.",great for kids into construction vehicles!,1412208000,

We enjoy reading this book as a family, and the pictures are just fantastic. The book highlights each individual truck as they wind down for the day, go through their own bedtime routines, and get tucked in. My son says ""nanight"" to each one before turning the page. As each new truck gets tucked in you can see the other trucks already asleep as shadows in the background, which my son also likes to point out! The rhythm is perfect, as well as the length of the book. The variety of trucks is perfect hitting on all of my sons favorites (excavator, bulldozer, dump truck, cement mixer and crane truck). It's also educational since it introduces each truck with the type of work that they do, and uses correct terminology when referring to specific parts of the truck (i.e. the cement mixer's chute and crane truck's boom).

Our son has, since he was old enough to recognize big machines, been fascinated with trucks, tractors, and construction vehicles.  My house literally looks like a work site because we own at least one of every kind of construction vehicle imaginable (except a pile driver, which we are currently looking into).  Needless to say, when I saw this book, I knew he would enjoy it.  What I did not expect was that my husband and I would also look forward to reading this one.

This book is beautifully illustrated; each truck is drawn in detail and given faces and personalities that little ones can appreciate.  The writing is solid; the language is age appropriate without feeling as though the author is talking down to the child.  The rhythm flows and tells a great story of construction machines getting ready for bed.  My son has his favorite pages, of course, including the owl on the cover page (""Mommy, what's he doing sitting up there?"") and the page where Dump Truck snores himself to sleep and a man hollers out a window to Pipe Down!  (""He's grumpy, isn't he, Mommy?"")

We giggle and snuggle while reading this every night.

My son loves that the crane truck has a teddy bear to snuggle with (we now have a teddy in bed at night too) and a star nightlight he hangs from his boom. And that Cement Mixer takes a bath ""Like me Momma!!!"" and has a blanket he covers up with ""I cover up too Momma!""

It also taught my son (and me) all the names and jobs of the different construction vehicles. I love that. Now when we are playing in the dirt and sand with our Tonka trucks, he gives them storylines, jobs, and tucks them in at night.

They had it propped up on top of the a shelf in the children's section, and I grabbed it thinking it might the good for bedtime reading with my almost-3-year-old boy.  I was not disappointed.

The illustrations grab your attention first.  They are beautiful renditions of a cartoony construction site where the trucks and and other equipment are the workers.  The coloring in the pictures looks like colored pencils, so there is a lot of texture and color gradient.  I love them.  My son loves Crane Truck's teddy bear and star-shaped night light, and the faces that Cement Mixer makes during his work day.

I was surprised that the story is a poem.  It's hard to pull off a good poem with strong rhythm and rhyme that young kids can wrap their minds around, but Sherri Duskey Rinker does a very good job.  Each page holds true to the meter that starts on page one and extends to the end of the book.  I was impressed at how easily the words flow when read aloud.  And the ""sound effects"" that each piece of equipment makes are fun to add in.  (My son likes the bulldozer's ""rooaaar"" in particular and won't let me skip it.)

Sherri Duskey Rinker also does a wonderful job of personifying the construction equipment.  They take on the humanoid actions of working, closing up shop, and going to bed.  The beautiful illustrations only help to add to this delightful representation.

And the work described is true to life, as well.  Sherri Duskey Rinker explains in simple, easy-for-young-minds-to-understand form the work that each piece of equipment performs in the real world.

The book is broken into an overall intro to the construction site needing to go to bed, followed by each individual type of construction vehicle going to bed, and an ending to the entire construction site with all of the vehicles asleep.  Each night you can literally read the intro and finale with one vehicle put to bed in between without ruining the overall feel of the book.  This reduces monotony and frees up time to read a different book first.  It also leaves some anticipation on the kid's part because they never know which truck you will read about that night.  Also if you are more into reading the book from start to finish, and a kid looks really sleepy, you can easily skip to the end and be done faster.  Some kids will catch on to your skipping portions of the book, but if they are really falling asleep they should not wake up.",Can Read In Portions so never gets Monotonous.

The book starts out with tracing activities - drawing lines, following curved paths, etc. When my daughter had turned 2, I bought her the Kumon tracing book which has these same types of activities. I had also created tracing activities at home just with paper and pencil (I draw letters or shapes and have her trace them -- that was so fun for her a few months ago). I think the tracing section is probably good practice if a child hasn't already been exposed to that type of activity, but otherwise it's boring.

The book then moves into colors and shapes, such as ""color the hearts red"" or  ""trace the rectangles."" This might be good if your kid is still learning shapes and colors, but we have pretty much skipped all of those pages.

Then comes the alphabet section. Each letter has about 4 activities, and they are all the same! First the letter is introduced with a coloring page, e.g., letter C has a picture of a cat to be colored. Then comes circling words beginning with c. Then is a page with pictures and five hidden letter C's, followed by a maze. Some other letters have activities such as ""color all the kites that have a letter k on them."" There are way too many color pages, which just feel like filler material.

My daughter likes the mazes, so that's all we have done with the letter pages. Occasionally she will humor me into doing the activity to find the words beginning with a certain letter, but that's too easy for her.

The number pages feel less repeaty and are a little more fun since they involve counting. However, my daughter likes to count and is very into numbers and simple math, so maybe it's just based on child preference. Sample activities for the numbers are ""color the rocket ships that have 3 windows"" or ""circle the aliens that have 3 eyes.""

The activities that do seem to be challenging for her are the connect the dot pictures. I help her quite a bit with those.

In the back of the book are concepts such as same and different, finding matching images, finding images that go together, crossing out the picture that doesn't belong, etc. These are a little more fun, but again, that might be child preference.

This book would get more stars if such a large portion weren't devoted to repeat activities.

We like the Comprehensive Curriculum pre-k book better.",Too easy and repetitious,1512086400,

The books have changed throughout the years, but I have liked the changes.  The reason I like them is that the amount of writing is just right.  Kids can learn their colors, numbers and letters before they can write them.  I like that the book contains little writing and instead focuses on circling and a little bit of coloring.  I also like how the book is organized.  I pull one sheet from each color every time my son sits down to do the school work.  I also love the bright colors and pictures.  If a child does not know what a picture is than it is a good time to tell them what new things are.  My 3 yr old son begs to do school work.

I started these books with all 3 of my kids at 3yrs old.  My 3 yr old son (who is almost 4) is now about 1/2 way through the kindergarten book.  All of my children seemed to have similiar pacing.  The transition between preschool and kind books are perfect.  As he has been able to do it all without struggling and little help (except reading the directions and covering new concepts).  I think the ages are not quite right though, but that does not really matter to me.  It is really geared for 3 to 4 yr olds and the kinder book should be finished before starting kindergarten as our kindergarten expects you to know everything in it.  After the kindergarten book there is a big gap which i am not sure how to fill (they need a transition between the Kinder and 1st grade book) as my son understands the concepts of reading and can sound out very simple words.  He is still a long way from reading fluently.  My other son is doing well in 1st grade and is just now finishing the 1st grade book.  The have made the kinder and preschool books more user friendly and actually easier, but along the way they jumped too much from one age level to the next.

Uh, okay, but that's REAL LIFE for women in STEM career paths.

The story is quite moving on its own but even more so when Kate ends the video by saying that they have a lot of engineers working for them at the International Space Station and that she hopes someday they have Rosie Revere working for them too!

The story is in rhyme but despite that it does not have a babyish feel. It is easy to relate to Rosie's fear of failure inadvertently created by her family. Her favorite uncle, Zookeeper Fred, laughs at her when she gives him a hat she invented for him to keep snakes off his head. He thinks she is ""cute"" but she is embarrassed and decides to keep her dreams to herself after that. She does until her great-great-aunt visits and says she has on one ""thrill"" left on her list that she has not accomplished - to fly. Rosie invents a machine to help her fly. The machine only briefly flies and this relative laughs too. However, Aunt Rose laughs because of joy and happiness and her encouragement allows Rosie to flourish and stop hiding her dreams!

If your own two-year-old is one with a shorter attention span, the book will still take hold of her or his heart a little later. If your kiddo is between 4-6, maybe 7, this book will ROCK.

Oh yeah, and the message. THE MESSAGE! :-) Girl Power, baby. But not overtly. Rosie is NEVER ridiculed because she's a girl. Her challenges have NOTHING whatsoever to do with gender. But she IS a girl. And her new hero and mentor IS an iconic WOMAN. And that's what I wanted. A protagonist with whom my own little girl might identify. Awesome. Super Highly Recommended.

This is a great story because Rosie, in the story, is an engineer, with lots of ideas and is very creative but she is made fun of by her family members for her creative ideas. Her wild aunt comes along and encourages her to continue to build on her ideas. A quote from the book that I really loved is Life might have its failures, but this was not it.

Rosie Revere Engineer is a great story and I love everything that great-great aunt Rose says to her when her plane crashes.  I borrow her words all the time when my daughter gets frustrated with a task.

It took me several weeks to realize that the last page has an introduction to Rosie the Riveter.

Therefore, it does take more patience for my toddler to sit still while I finish reading the page.

The story is told in enjoyable rhyme (a lot of times ""rhymes"" are so forced it's just painful, but not this book), and the story is important for children and adults alike.  The story line explains how Rosie, once a vibrant, vivacious engineer who enjoyed coming up with inventions TO HELP PEOPLE SHE LOVED, has had her confidence shattered by an adult who laughed at the gift she made for him.  In all likelihood, he was probably one of those adults who thinks it is perfectly appropriate and charming to laugh at children (as if just because they are children it means we are laughing with them -- they know better).  So she scraps her dreams and decides never to invent -- or be humiliated-- again.  Along comes her aged aunt (and apparent namesake), who talks to Rosie about the things in life she wishes she had done but never got around to doing.  To help her aged aunt fulfill those last wishes, Rosie pushes past her trepidation and invents a flying machine.  It crashes to the ground.  Rosie is devastated and once again determined to never invent or be embarrassed by her ""failures"" again.  Thank Goodness for her feisty Aunt Rose, who teaches the big life lesson of this book:  Success is built on failure, and tenacity.  ""The machine crashed, yes, but before that, it flew!""  It was a starting point to learn from and continuing improving on.  ""The only true failure comes when you quit.""  As the mother of a young girl, I also love that the engineer in the story is a girl, but if I had a son, I would still read it to him all the time.  This is just a great book.

I bought it in the store for my 5.5 year old boy because he's very interested in engineering so I've been trying to find books that show engineers. I admit I didn't look too closely at the story before I bought it, but boy was I blown away when we finally read it. It is clever and cute and thought provoking. Even my son, who normally doesn't want to read anything that's not about superheroes, love the book and has asked to read it repeatedly in just the last 2 days. It opened up natural questions and conversations (many even initiated by my son) about how women have been treated in history and today, what it takes to invent something, what family can and should do to support each other, even what graph paper is and what it's used for! It's not preachy, though, just a great story.

I see some other reviews mention the negative reactions of adults in this book, but I strongly disagree that those are a problem. Kids DO get told all the time that they can't do something, shouldn't do something. They're assessed thousands of times at school, in their grades, standardized testing, etc and often made to feel that they're not measuring up. Why pretend they're never going to face criticism or someone blocking their way? And Rosie overcomes her fear of people's reactions, and she joins her class in their inventing proudly. Even my son immediately picked up on the message. When I asked him at the end of our first read what he thought Rosie learned in the book, he immediately said ""To not stop trying just because someone laughs at you."" Kids can handle that message! This is a book about perseverance, not an instruction manual on being an engineer.

The illustrations are very charming, and my son has been enjoying spotting all of Rosie's inventions in the book. Honestly this is the best children's book we've read in a long time. It works on many different levels and is just plain enjoyable.","Fun, positive, and engaging story!",1442188800,

Late at night, tucked away in the attic she creates gadgets and gizmos out of salvaged garbage that will never see the light of day. Can anything, or anyone, convince Rosie to change her mind and face her fear of failure?

There is a lot to love about Rosie Revere, Engineer, from its whimsical rhyming prose, to its incredibly detailed Art Deco inspired illustrations. But, what truly earns this jewel of a story its wings is its always relevant and hopeful message about embarrassment and failure anxiety. Young children learn to internalize adult opinions early on in their life, and most will be able to relate to Rosie as she secrets away her passion, afraid of rejection, and eventually battles those fears to bring joy to someone she loves.

Rosie Revere is hailed by feminists as an amazing book for girls due to its strong female characters, including the feminist icon Rosie the Riveter, and its STEM (STEAM) subject matter, and they are right to think so. Rosie and her Great Great Aunt Rose are excellent role models for inventive little girls everywhere. It is equally an important book for boys who need to hear as much as girls that it is all right to try and fail, and it is all right to be themselves, even when others don't believe in them.

5.0,10,True,"01 5, 2015",A3MABF9M7CTDP6,1419708457,{'Format:': ' Hardcover'},Dana,"We bought this book for our 4.5 year old daughter. It is a great book. The rhythm and rhyme make it really fun to read and the illustrations are really interesting and warrant lingering over. The overall message of the book is to not give up and that failures/flops are a necessary part of trying something new.

I read a number of reviews that complained about how the uncle laughs at her invention, and I wanted to touch on that. The context for this is that she invents a hat to protect him from snakes. A main feature of this hat is that it sprays spray-cheese all over the place. It's funny. Rosie didn't intend for it to be funny and is hurt by the laughter, but the uncle is quick to say he loves the hat (although Rosie refuses to believe him). My daughter finds this situation very relatable. Kids often find themselves accidentally funny and often the adults around them fail to play it cool. My daughter is particularly sensitive to these situations. The book gave us the opportunity to talk about how sometimes things are funny, even when they aren't meant to be and when people laugh, it's not intended to be mean. It's something inventors often face, I imagine, and knowing that it shouldn't dictate how you proceed is a good thing.

Overall, this book offers a view of a young girl who invents. You see her get discouraged and, later, overcome that discouragement. She learns that failure happens, and is even necessary and good. All that to a lovely rhyme and with great pictures means it is sure to be read over and over again.","Rosie Revere, Engineer",1420416000,

1.) My 3-year-old is very interested in machines. This book's illustrations include lots of contraptions that Rosie is building, and my son wants to know how they work. He is not satisfied with anything but the most detailed response. Unfortunately, the way things are drawn, the machines can't do the things they're shown doing (like a pull handle, attached in such a way that it can only be pulled, attached to something that would have to be pushed for the machine to work). If your kid is also interested in the actual mechanics of things, I'd skip this one.
2.) It talks about Rosie digging through the trash for supplies to build. My 3 & 2-year-olds have never taken stuff out of the trash. Until now. Grrrrrrrr.
3.) This might seem silly to some, but I heard about this book because it was recommended by the organization A Mighty Girl, and I was a little disappointed that the main character's appearance comes up in the text (just that her hair covers one eye), in a way that's not integral to the story. Why does her hairstyle matter? It has nothing to do with the story. It's lazy writing (stuck in because they needed a rhyme) that reinforces some negative aspects of our culture that I specifically bought this book to try to counteract.

That said, the Rosie the Riveter tie-in is cute and I think it would make a cute gift for someone who's into rockabilly culture. It does have a good message about overcoming fear and failure by trying again.

Update: My 2-year-old who loves dolls keeps asking me to read this book and was finally able to explain to me why. A lot of the contraptions illustrated in the book incorporate parts of dismembered dolls. She's trying to figure out what happened to the dollies, and is pretty upset about it.

Dailey,"This book tries not to be sexist but ends up being really, really sexist, especially when compared with its slightly less sexist companion book, Iggy Peck, Architect.  Iggy Peck's story begins with, ""Iggy Peck is an architect and has been since he was two,"" and then it goes on to describe his ingenious toddler creativity, which becomes thwarted in elementary school by his architecture-hating teacher, a neurotic woman who's traumatized by having gotten lost in the Empire State Building as a child.  Iggy saves her life, heals her neurosis, and is not only a hero but then takes on the role of lecturing his class each week on architecture, supplanting his neurotic teacher.  Rosie Revere, by contrast, is hampered by insecurity and easily daunted by others' criticism.  Her creations are acknowledged failures, and she's deemed adequately successful if she can just keep trying despite failure (go, Rosie!).  Her great aunt, the iconic Rosie the Riveter, is an obese crone who cheers on young Rosie's failures--failures Rosie constructs in secret to avoid criticism.  In the end, unlike Iggy, an acknowledged authority on architecture and Rosie's classmate, wallflower Rosie is just happy not to be crushed by her neuroses, even if she is still pretty much a failure and invisible to everyone except her absurdly fat aunt.

I was a little cautious because the negative reviews implied a number of lessons I did not necessarily want to provide my granddaughter.  Well, some of those reviewers either received a completely different book, or have some grudge against real life and positive messages.  The book is about a young, shy girl who makes her own gadgets out of junked items.  Yes, an Uncle laughs at her spray cheese can hat device to keep snakes away.  And, yes the uncle is a zoo keeper.  And, the uncle's laughter hurts her feelings and causes her to stop working on her inventions for a while.  But, the story is about bouncing back from disappointments and failures, not about a mythical perfect world where all Uncles are perfect and there are no zoos, and helicoptering parents are ever present to protect you.  So, an Aunt also laughs at Rosie's flying machine invention failure. And, Rosie is disappointed and decides to stop inventing. But, the Aunt's laughter is based on amazement, or enthusiasm, or perhaps just on seeing a spinning cheese spraying contraption try to fly.  The Aunt embraces Rosie and her failed machine and teaches her that failure is part of the process of succeeding.  So, this is good book that promotes a good lesson.

In her spare time, she's constantly on the look out for discarded trash that she can use in her latest invention. She builds delightful things like snake repelling hats and helium pants (my personal favorite), but she mistakes delighted laughter for contempt.

When her great-great-aunt Rose (also in a polka dot kerchief) comes to visit, Rosie is inspired by their common love machines and adventures (hint: great-great-Aunt Rose used to be a riveter, during the war). With the following Seussian words from great-great-Aunt Rose, Rosie learns that every apparent failure is just an opportunity to learn something new and try a different approach.

Life might have its failures, but this was not it.
The only true failure can come if you quit.
By the end of the book, Rosie's entire class has become a community of makers, working and learning together, building great gizmos, gadgets, and doohickeys.

This is a book about the glory of failures, the importance of trying, and the necessity of believing in yourself. Rosie revels in inventing, building, and engineering, there's not a princess in sight. The writing has the lilt and flow of a Dr. Seuss book. The illustrations are beautifully done and capture the spirit of the characters perfectly.

Rosie is a great book for girls probably from 2-6, The Girl loves it and we've already had to read it several times a day since she received it on Christmas Eve. Emotions of frustration of failure are turned to the triumph of failure in a way that children can relate to. There's enough silliness in the book (all of the inventions seem to involve cheese) to appeal to children, but not enough to make it intolerable to humbug adults like me.

Great-great Aunt Rose teaches Rosie a fine lesson when her cheese-copter crashes after hovering for only a few moments.

""""Your brilliant first flop was a raging success!
Come on, let's get busy and on to the next!""
She handed a notebook to Rosie Revere,
who smiled at her aunt as it all became clear.

dear Rosie made gadgets and gizmos she loved.
And when she grew sleepy, she hid her machines
far under the bed, where they'd never be seen.""

Rosie Revere is a girl with a dream. She wants to be a great engineer, but ever since her favorite uncle laughed at her invention, she's kept her creations for her eyes only. Then her oldest relative, great-great-aunt Rose (Rosie the Riveter) comes to visit and shares her unfulfilled dream--to fly. So Rosie decides to build a flying machine. Her first try is a glorious flop, but Rosie gains a little perspective and learns that trying is more important than instant success.

I enjoyed the historical link of having Rosie the Riveter in the story, though I find it hard to believe that the real Rosie the Riveter could have gone so long wanting but unable to fly. Certainly airplanes have been around long enough that a cheese-copter would be unnecessary. I also had to wonder about Rosie's insistence on cheese-powered creations.

While all the illustrations are lively and colorful, my favorites show designs sketched onto the familiar engineering grid paper--it's a taste of ""real"" engineering and history. I love the upbeat Seussian rhythm and rhyme. This is a fun story with a great message about learning from failure that applies to everyone--not just aspiring engineers.

Right about the time I was being scared to death about growing a woman-sized body, the Boston Women's Health Book Collective came out with their groundbreaking work,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Bodies-Ourselves/dp/1439190666/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Bodies, Ourselves</a>, which presented women's health and sexuality from a woman's perspective.

That loud and proud feminist theme is reflected in these mainstream body books which explain the dramatic changes that happen during puberty from a girl-sized perspective. Each of the 33 chapters is no more than 2 pages long on facing sides and illustrated in an array of colors with short paragraph-style descriptions. This Body Book for Older Girls gives your child access to information about their bodies in a way that is encouraging and positive. There's no baby talk in these books: pubic hair and vagina, breasts and nipples and periods and tampons are fully explained and illustrated. For a young girl, this grownup approach - albeit in cartoon-style graphics - can turn a bewildering life change into an empowering adventure.

If you have a pubescent girl in your home, I highly recommend this book. Your child can use this resource as an opening for further discussions with you about the care and keeping of her body beautiful.",Ms. Body Beautiful,1361059200,

I liked the examples and the way it always went back to ""if you have any questions ask your parents"" so she could learn a little on her own and still feel comfortable asking questions. The main thing that I wanted to strive with her was puberty and everything associated with it is NORMAL and this did an ok job of getting that point across. I liked the emotional information because it had some thought provoking questions that made me think so I hope it does her too. The one thing I did not like as much was as a medical professional I hoped that it would be more anatomical in information but we have other books for that.

I noticed when I checked out books from the library, she did not want to look at them, mostly because she worried that someone would see them. However, downloading it to her iPad and hiding it in a folder, she feels much more comfortable looking through it. We read through a large portion of it together and it helped to clear up a lot of her questions. I think, for the most part, that this book is very thorough in explaining all of the many changes that girls experience during puberty. However, there is one thing that continues to irk me a bit. The diagram of the female genitals does not label the clitoris. Why? Having a daughter and also having friends with daughters, I have found that often times a girl's first question about her genitals is ""What's this bump?"" I can understand the fact that this book does not delve into sex and reproduction but the clitoris is a part of the body that the girls see and it should be, at the very least, labeled.

The Care and Keeping of You 2 is a sequel aimed at girls over 10-years-old and continues its users manual approach of educating them about their minds and bodies, this time delving just a bit deeper in the unique female attributes and covering some of the more intimate matters such using feminine hygiene products, wearing underwear, eating disorders, the female psyche in relation to friends and family, and bad influences like peer pressure.  Using the same simple and declarative language of the first book, it does away with any technical explanations in favor of simple declarative sentences yet with enough authority that the intended audience will be able to accept and make use of the information the first time they read it.  Expectedly, its rich illustrations are also provocative - there is a sequence of girl performing breast exam, an abridged depiction of the female reproductive system, and a sequence on the proper insertion of a tampon.

I do have one almost trivial problem with some the illustrations. In the Chapter ""The Anatomy of You"", the author emphasizes the anatomically correct labeling to the female reproductive organs yet does not use ""vulva"" at all. Inexplicably, parts like the clitoris or hymen are also not mentioned, despite the clitoris being depicted. Far be it for me to tell another author write about or what girls should know, but I cannot think of any good reason why they were not mentioned.

In general, if you or your young daughter enjoyed the first book, you will like this one. As a matter of fact, you can enjoy this book without ever reading the first book.  The book designates itself for girls ten and up or going through puberty, but I suppose great conversation starter as well when trying to gauge the developmental knowledge of the young girls in your family without going on tangents like talking about where babies come from or the anatomical differences between girls and boys. For something like that, there is this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/one-incredible-book/dp/0671041576/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">one incredible book</a>&nbsp;that goes deeper to explain female development, but the content and depth is more for the middle school/high school level girl.

It seems perfect for this age.  It deals with changes in body and emotions, but avoids the topic of the sex act altogether.

It has an upbeat ""this is normal"" tone to it, and repeatedly advises the reader to ask her parents (or other adult) if they have problems or questions, something that I appreciated very much.  It points out that peers are not a good source for information, since they may also be confused.  The book seems geared for young girls about ages 10-11, depending on maturity level.

I hope to have the same kind of relationship with my girls as they get older. But sometimes it helps to read things from another source. A source that ISN'T another mostly-clueless preteen!

As I said, I plan to give this to my girls when they are ready to read it on their own, but I also intend to discuss it with them. The book has so many great topics that I would never have thought to discuss with my girls, so in addition to giving them good, interesting things to learn about, it will also open up new conversation topics for us. Yes, it covers the usual subjects of female puberty, and it does so in great detail (such as the pros and cons of tampons vs. pads, UTI's, moodiness), but it also addresses topics about life in general, how to eat healthy, how to have healthy sleep patterns, how to respect yourself and embrace your clothing size.

So working with her personality and discussing the changes of her body was a challenge since she would shut down whenever the subject got even remotely close. When she was in 4th I got her the first book in the care and keeping of you along with the journal. I made her read the book and then use the journal to answer questions about herself. What I liked about the journal is it asked leading questions for the girl to use with her mother. This helped us tremendously and while she is still embarrassed with what is going on inside her she knows coming to me is safe ground. Now this book; my daughter is now in 6th and still going through changes. The differences in the book are obvious. The illustrations in the first are a little more cartoonish and definitely for a younger girl. The illustrations in book 2 are more mature. The discussions are more mature as well. Some parents may be shocked at some of the illustrations showing changes in breast and how to use a tampon. However, for girls like my daughter who is private about her body the illustrations are much easier for her. 2 reinforces the subjects discussed in the first book but also expands to include more family dynamics and social circles. What I'm really impressed with is the constant reminder to talk with your mom or some other trusted adult. Both books have ""submitted"" questions from girls and responses that are appropriate for the subject. Lastly a Glossary is included at the end of book 2 not included in the first to define terms used that a girl may not know - from Acne to Yeast Infection.

  This book is short, right about 100pages, it explains really anything a girl would have questions about the changes that are going on in her body, and it always defers to the parents or an adult.  Meaning, she always says if you have questions ask your parents, they are there to help you, which I thought was awesome, more young ladies need to hear this from a third party source.  :)

  The material answers many questions about periods, tampons/pads, body changes, shaving legs, etc, but it still leaves plenty of room for discussion with parents, it is not a text  book, but a cursory view.  I think the one thing I thought should have been discussed a little more was eating disorders as bulimia and anorexia are not the only two, there is a third VERY common one called ""Binge Eating Disorder"" or ""BED"", it is essentially bulimia without the vomiting, laxatives, and over exercise.

  I know this is not a book on eating disorders, but since it does give a couple pages to the issue, it would have been important to mention BED.  A lot of young women struggle with this issue, and I feel at least a cursory overview of it would have been beneficial.  it is just as destructive to your health.  I had all 3 of those eating disorders in different times in my life.  They were all equally destructive to my health in different ways.

  I liked that it goes over body image and how you should never compare yourself to anymore, whether its how you like or when you start your period or when you get your breasts.  Everybody is going to be different and that is a-okay, and in fact it is normal!  Being that it comes from a Dr., it will hopefully ring more true for girls, then again, at that age, do they really care who it comes from as long as its not a parent?  lol

  Loved the little Q&A sections they were fun and had good questions/answers,  Some of them I had to laugh at, but they were, after all, from 10-12yr girls, it was cute and relevant for other 10-12yr girls.  Loved the question about shaving legs, which ironically, my mother wouldn't let me shave them till I was like 13yrs, and I had boys make fun of me for it.  She just didn't feel it was appropriate or necessary, which I can definitely see where she was coming from, it really wasn't necessary, even if I felt it was.  Though she let me wear makeup since I was like 5yrs, so there was a weird dichotomy going on... lol

  Anyway, I look forward to sharing this with my niece(s)/friends daughters, I definitely feel they will get a lot out of it.  :D

There were some things in there I did not like.  A lot of the info I thought was good and was fine with her reading, so I just covered up the stuff I didn't want her reading.  The stuff I covered up, were about negative body image.  One example is about freckles.  My daughter has freckles, and it is not a negative thing to her.  In the book, there is a girl saying how she hates her freckles and wants to know how to get rid of them, and talks about creams to lighten them.  The book does say to embrace them and gives the girl good advice, but I didn't want to put in my daughter's head that freckles are a negative thing, which is what I felt when I read it.  It addresses other issues, and it offers good advice, however, my daughter has zero issues with some topics discussed and I don't want her suddenly thinking, ""Oh!  Am I fat?  Am I flat chested?"", etc.  The book addresses negative self image, which is great if a girl needs it.  Also, in the beginning it says how the things in the book can be embarrassing to talk about.  I omitted that, because it shouldn't be embarrassing, and I don't think it will be unless I make it uncomfortable..

The Good:

It's got nice pictures throughout.  The writing is simple and easy to understand, working well for girls that are either teenagers, pre-teens, or girls even just curious and wanting to learn more about their bodies.

The Bad:

It introduces girls to a lot of topics that as a mom, I'm not impressed with.  I don't like that the author talks about body imagery as though it's a negative thing and that girls shouldn't be offended by what others think.  While I agree that it's not about what others think, an 8-year doesn't need to be worried about the possibility that someone *MAY* be judging her.  Why plant that seed of self-doubt when all there is is confidence now?

The other thing I'm not a fan of is that while this does talk a lot about adolescent things girls will go through such as growing body hair, body odor, acne, growing a chest, and getting your period, the book however does not talk about WHY a girl goes through these changes.  Not that I think a girl should learn about the birds and the bees from a book but the book shouldn't assume that a young girl is going to understand why she's bleeding once a month ""down there.""  By itself, it can leave room for a lot of questions and a lot of fear with someone young.","Be ready to be a mom first, then read WITH your daughter",1515110400,

We are pretty open, but I thought a book may provide her with more information about things she might be too shy to ask me or just provide her with more information about things I may have forgotten to talk about. This book is easy to read, straightforward, and provides factual information. I looked at ALL the puberty books and read hundreds of reviews before settling on this one.

HOWEVER, there is one aspect of the book I do not like, an aspect that several other reviewers also mentioned. This book is written for 8-9 year olds, yet it brings up many issues one could be made to feel insecure about: wearing glasses, body type, freckles, developing early, etc. My daughter currently has a very healthy self esteem. She doesn't give a thought to whether she's too thin or too fat, and she's always loved her freckles, which we call 'angel kisses.' I don't want it to get into her head that these are things to worry about or dislike about yourself. Before I gave her the book, I told her there were questions about girls not liking certain things about themselves, but you should love yourself just they way you are, as God made us all perfectly imperfect!","Easy reading, factual, but may not be the best book if your little girl is insecure!",1508976000,

Given the fact that I divorced their mother several years ago, and despite being re-married to a woman who is a great support system for the girls, I have largely raised my girls from the perspective of their father, their friend, their sports coach, as well as playing the role of a mom in many ways.

I have an incredible relationship with my daughters, and we talk about everything--because of their surroundings resulting from the divorce, they've been forced to grow up quickly like many children today.  I do my best on a daily basis to prepare them and to treat them with dignity, respect, care, love, and guidance.  With that said, I don't have all of the answers, and while I can research things and explain them from an outsider's perspective, this book is a fantastic resource for several reasons:

1.) The content - it covers a lot in a small package, topics ranging from changing bodies to eating habits, exercise, and hygiene guidance.
2.) The ease of presentation - my daughter ADORES the way the book is presented.  She feels very comfortable laying in bed at bedtime and reading a section or two with me, and having comfortable dialog about often-times uncomfortable content for a 10yo.
3.) The portrayal of not being alone - One of my favorite components of this book, is that through the verbiage and imagery, it's clear that no girl is unique in encountering these issues, but they ARE very unique in when, what, and how... it doesn't make my girl feel weird about the content.

I read voraciously and review from time to time, but I really do insist that parents scoop this one up... it's a very valuable buy.","You're not alone, kiddo!",1502236800,

I think this book fit well. There are a few things that I think should be changed but for the most part this book is good. It helped me explain everything to her and adds other things like brushing your hair and things that aren't uncomfortable. She said she liked it. We read it together and then she asked if she could look over it by herself. I wanted to make sure she knew about periods I didn't want her to think she was dieing if she got it without knowing what it was. Kids these days are having periods earlier than years before.

It's a very easy read with lots of tasteful pictures and Q and A pages in case the girl is too shy to ask questions.  We read a chapter a day, and if she had any questions, it was easy to ask.  This book doesn't talk about sex education, but it does talk about what happens with the female body as it goes through adolescence.

I told her to read through it and any questions she had, to come to me about. Some parents might want to read along but I wanted her learning to be more independent and self sufficient. This book certainly opened up lines of communication between us and lead to some conversations that were easier to have with us both having an informed opinion.

Not only did this make the whole 'period' conversation much easier (for both of us!) but she's been being more self responsible. She's taken more intiative on her hygiene instead of being reminded, brushing her hair and teeth more often, and even felt brave enough to not only ask for a bra (because she feels all 'jiggly') but exactly what type she wanted.","Wonderful Book, staple for any young girl.

The reason so many books are written on the topic is because there is no clear-cut formula that answers all the questions. What information should be provided, and when, and by whom, and to what level of detail?

This book (and the others in the series) provide light overviews of some of the more common physical and emotional realities kids will face, presented in easily digestible and often amusing language, and accompanied by inoffensive illustrations that steer clear of overly simplifying a complex set of topics. Kids are indeed smarter than we imagine, but they are also more sensitive. Sometimes a book such as this one, that lets them know the changes they are experiencing are not only normal, but far from scary, provides just enough succor and support to give them the confidence to keep moving forward, with renewed confidence that their bodies are healthy, strong, and personal property: to be nurtured, cherished, protected, and strengthened.

We parents are no longer the captains of the team, we are becoming the coaches and cheerleaders, and this simple playbook makes it a little easier to stand on the sidelines, increasingly confident that our kids are smart enough to avoid injury, and be the winners they deserve to be.","Life is a tough game.

I developed on the earlier side, as did my mother, so I am anticipating she may start pre-puberty in the next year or so. I am so glad I decided to read through the book before showing it to her because I have decided to return it and look for something else. As another reviewer mentioned, this book has a lot of content that could actually CAUSE insecurities about her body rather than prevent them.

What I like about the book:
It is simply written and easy for a younger girl to understand. It talks about puberty in a mostly positive way. It has fun illustrations that would appeal to my daughter and does talk about all bodies being different and so on, BUT

What I DONT like about the book:
As of now my daughter has a very positive self/body image. She is very comfortable in the skin she is in.  From my observations, most girls in the target age of this book, 8-11, haven't quite gotten the message yet that they should be looking critically at their own bodies or judge others for how they look. If they read this book, though, they WILL be exposed to these concepts. While my daughter does have a positive self-image at the moment and we have worked hard to cultivate that, I also know (and remember) how fragile that can be at the tween stage and the power of suggestion is huge at this age.

Here are some examples:
My daughter has a beautiful speckling of freckles across her nose. Most people around her have commented that they love them. SHE loves them. She said to me a few months ago that she wished she had MORE freckles. In this book, on page 36: I have freckles. I hate them and wish I could get some lotion that would make my freckles go away. I need help! While she loves her freckles, I could see reading this she may start to question how she feels about them. I could imagine her thinking, Wait, are freckles considered to be ugly?

Page 50-51, three questions are about girls insecurities of having a flat chest, then this one: I have bigger boobs than all of my friends. Because of this, my friends are embarrassed to be around me because they think Im very ugly and fat. I used to be very popular, but now I find myself dorky and lonely. Yikes! Really?? I developed breasts earlier than my friends and was definitely insecure about them, wearing large shirts, etc., but NEVER did I ever think my friends wouldnt like me because of them. The message that people may not like you because of anything having to do with your physical appearance is horrible. I know it is rampant in our culture, but I really would like to keep my young daughter from being exposed to this idea as long as I can. I realize the book is trying to prevent these kinds of thoughts, but the question in itself may get girls wondering and thinking about these things, not to mention re-enforcing the message that if you are fat, you are unlikable.

In the same vain, pages 62-63, titled Body Talk, all four questions from girls are about how other girls are thinner;  how to stay thin; how to get thinner; and comparing your own body to your friends'. Talk about re-enforcing the idea that thin is ideal!  I know the answers talk about all bodies being different and not to compare yourself, but these questions themselves might get our daughters thinking about whether they are thin enough and that it is normal to compare their bodies to their friends'. Yes, I realize she will face these issues at some point. I just feel there is no need to get these thoughts going at such an early age.

This is getting so long, but just know there are other parts in the book talking about comparing yourself to others physically; calling someone pizza face because of acne; insecurities if you haven't gotten your period yet and are not considered a woman like your friends, etc. Again, I know that these are presented as questions and the book is telling the girls not to do those things or feel these ways, but the power of suggestion is so strong.

I wish there was a simple book about bodily changes/puberty which I could read to an eight year old girl without going in to explicit details about sex. This book would be much better if it just stuck to the facts about physical changes during puberty, how to take care of yourself, etc. and left out the question/answer section. The questions seem more appropriate for the second book for older girls (if even), not the target age of this book. I saw one recommendation in another review for ""Reaching for the Moon,"" by Lucy H. Pearce. I will try that and then leave an update here.",Read the book first to see if it is a good fit for your child,1445904000,

She's now 8 1/2, and she's read through this many times. We used this book as a method for introducing and opening up topics about her growth and body changes. We talked about each chapter and section, and because much of it was on the horizon, we feel comfortable that she knows she can talk with us about any of the issues in this book without shyness or embarrassment. There are some areas where we have wanted to go deeper - one commenter mentions that it doesn't go into the itty-bitty details of what is happening when menstruation starts - but we aren't expecting this to be the one-all answer. It is a great book to open the conversation about daily body needs.  If I had one request, it would be for a bit more around washing or showering, and cleaning the vagina.

I borrowed this on a lark expecting some patronizing girl colors, nauseatingly cutesy illustrations, dumbed language and content that would make you would wonder if were made for reading and comprehension exercise but the authors and illustrators present themselves with such a depth and simplicity, anyone dealing with the growth of young girls ought to consider getting their own copy

The Care and Keeping of you is an informal user's manual explaining the less provocative features of young female bodies with simple elaborations and basic advice for general health and hygiene.  The author works her way down from head - explaining hair care, the importance of brushing and flossing of teeth, acne, eye care and dealing with having to wear glasses to the legs stressing the importance of exercise, shaving legs, foot care, and sleep. In between, it touches on everything that a young wants to know or needs like body image, menstruation, underwear, and something just as intimate - emotions.  The simple and declarative language makes the entire book easy to read yet with enough authority that they can accept and make use of the content the first time.  For better or worse, there are few technical explanations such as chemical process of menstruation or what exactly makes a healthy meal, instead encouraging the young reader on almost every subject to seek further advice from parents, trusted adults, and health care professionals to determine the best course of their lives.  Better there is very little provocative material - there is one sequence of illustrations that feature the five stages of breast growth and how a young girl properly uses a sanitary pad while sitting a on toilet but figure such matter are rather tame - its not more than what is presented in sex education in public schools.

I do have one almost trivial problem with the content.  The book is richly illustrated with young girls and parents going about their lives and the chapter entitled the ""Belly Zone"", the author explains proper nutrition and the varied shapes that girls come from and change to as they grow.  Appropriately, the authors are quick affirm that there is no ""normal"" shape, weight, or height, moreso since they are still growing but the more perspective/cynical reader might have noticed that the girls depicted in this book (albeit just illustrations) all had the same petite body type.  Of course, better critics will emphasize artistic license to defend this book, I dare say it's not enough to say that there is no normal body shape - you have to show it.

In general, it's an awesome book.  Written for the pre-puberty/going-through-puberty crowd, it tells what they need to know about themselves without going on tangents like where babies come, how boys are different from girls, or the chemical processes that make it all work.

They don't have a mother, and every girl needs a special someone to turn to in order to understand and not fear the changes they're going through and will go through (just around the corner). Little did I know that this book is by the American Girl Label, and both her and her younger sister love American Girl. It was immediately accepted as a ""book of gold"". I expressed to her that I am absolutely here for ANYTHING, ANYTIME she needs/wants to talk. She's got a wonderful father, but sometimes it takes an understanding woman available in order to keep the communication lines open and confusing changes in your body to be less feared and better understood. We've had the ""period"" talk, which went much smoother than I thought it would, thanks to this book. It appears that she is developing early, so it was a wise investment purchased not a moment too soon. She's now confident in talking to me about everything; and she's asking for the next books and journal for Christmas 2014. I'm happy to oblige.

I'm very grateful for the bond that I have with both girls. Now, her younger sister is reading the book and is more open to asking questions also.

This book opened the door to a stronger, more trusting relationship that would not have been as easy without this book. *Just a tip: read the book yourself. That way, any questions you are asked can be better planned for, and questions better understood. Plus, it's just best to understand what they are learning and the details. When I'm shown a page in the book and asked ""What does this part mean?"", I know exactly what they've read and how to comfortably answer it in a way that they can understand.

The best thing about this book is that it teaches girls what they need to know and understand at the age they are at. At 10, I started my monthly cycle. I was early, but I had no one to talk to. I only had a library full of books that informed me, but they also terrified me. I wasn't old enough to learn about subjects attached to you're period, such as details about sex. That's one thing I hoped to eliminate with this book. Yes, it does explain what a period is and why, but it does NOT explain sex or pregnancy. At 10 (the younger is 8), I can trust that this book won't terrify them like I was. The ""sex talk"" will happen when she's old enough to know. Some people believe in terrifying their child because it scares them into abstinence, but I'm not that type of parent. I encourage good choices based on information given to them in a way that encourages those positive choices. This book is an excellent tool for that.

I recommend this book to any mother, step mother or parental figure that wishes to have a stronger bond and open communication with every little girl/young lady in their lives. It's truly helpful, and we're all grateful for it!!

Thank you, American Girl, for helping the girls in my home to better understand themselves, and feel comfortable communicating their questions and any fears they may have.

Beware!  If you do not have an ANDROID device running Kindle Reader, you won't even be able to read this book.  Also, do not give this as a gift--it's NON-REFUNDABLE.  :-(

Sorry girls, you'll just have to figure it out on your own.

EDIT:  Since I wrote this review, Amazon has added a ""only works on these devices"" section.  Good going!  I only wish y'all'd done that before I paid for something that is USELESS to us.

To all you whingers who ""only want the content reviewed,"" well, #1. ""the content"" includes Kindle Store's products' ability to actually work on a KINDLE, and #2. instead of taking it out on me, why don't you complain to AMAZON and ask that there be some feedback mechanism for such information to be processed and shared with potential buyers, rather than just telling me that I'm wrong?  As it is, this review appears to have saved at least FIVE other people the agony of buying something from The Kindle Store that will not work on a KINDLE, and was probably instrumental in getting Amazon to add the note that this ""only works on these devices"" warning.  That seems a valid reason for reviewing as I have done here, and I certainly wish someone else had done so before I wasted my money.  Also, maybe take some reading comprehension and/or bother reading the explicit title of my review.

Sensitive issues about body changes are becoming a hot topic around here as we begin to deal with pre-puberty. Because she is such a huge bookworm I thought this would be a great starting off point for her to learn about body changes. I think that this is one subject where you really have to take into consideration your own child's personality and decide how to approach these sensitive topics. With that being said I asked her to read the book on her own time and then we could talk about any questions that she has, leaving the ball in her court and leaving the door to conversation WIDE open.

The book has definitely given her the courage to talk about something she was very unsure about. She understands her body now and is actually excited about the changes taking place (I was NOT as a child BUT no one gave me a book like this or talked to me about anything!). I think the book has given her courage to ask questions and even given her vocabulary about the issues she otherwise wasn't sure how to articulate, if that makes sense. I think it also made her aware of other changes that she was not even aware about. No matter how you decide to use this book or other material it is imperative that you not embarrass or belittle your child. It is also imperative that you are there for them and answer questions appropriately and honestly. If I ever feel that something is inappropriate to talk about then I honestly tell them, ""This isn't something that is appropriate right now but we will talk about it soon!"" And then don't go back on your promise.

Some pretty funny ""kids say the darndest things"" moments have also happened because of the book. She knows that these are private topics that stay at home so she's very comfortable saying things to us that might make others blush or stutter. I won't go into that here but I'm chuckling right now as I type this, thinking of the things she's said!

Finally I want to mention that we're a super conservative Christian family. I found nothing in this book that I felt was perverse or misguided or inappropriate. It is merely an anatomical book about changes that happen in early puberty. God created these wonderful bodies of ours and it's important to understand the changes *before* they happen. If there's something in ANY book that we don't exactly agree with then we use it as a teaching moment and explain that some people think dealing with emotions or friends ""this way"" is okay but this is how our family chooses to do it. If I am made aware of a serious problem in a book or one that is most definitely not Godly then we discard it but this book was well written and we've been pleased in how it has helped build our daughter's confidence in an uncertain and sometimes scary time in a young girl's life!

This book filled the bill nicely. As with most American Girl books, the text speaks to the child respectfully. The graphics are appealing, not at all silly yet not overly-detailed. I appreciated that this book did not tread on unnecessary ground regarding conception, contraception, etc. As a Catholic, I have had a hard time finding books that were not too graphic, that did not go into subjects contrary to my faith or beyond the child's maturity level, and yet were not too vague or old-fashioned and which make the topic seem taboo.

What worked for us and for my daughter's comfort level was for us to read the chapter on her period together, after which I allowed her to take the book and read the rest in privacy. She is an avid reader and likes reading about health, so that worked for us and none of the other chapters were so startling that she would not be okay with reading them on her own (e.g. hair growth, shaving, deodorant, breast development, bras, etc). The subject of menstruation was covered well. My only complaint would be that a couple of words, including vagina, were not defined in the chapter. That was okay for us because we were reading it together (which I think is the best way to use this chapter) so I was able to explain. Also, the picture of the uterus (just a little squiggle on a girl's abdomen) was a little bit abstract, so I was prepared in advance with a simple picture from an anatomy book.

This book helped my daughter be comfortable with the changes in her body. Each parent should decide what to read together and what, if anything, you feel comfortable having your daughter read on her own, depending on her age, maturity, and what is happening in her body already. For example, my daughter and I had already purchased bras for her together so that chapter was nothing unexpected.

The only thing I am on the fence about is the part about girls shaving their legs.  Really, what 8-10 year old needs to start shaving?  Not that the book said it that way, I just wish they had a bigger emphasis on talking to your parent about it first, rather than a small mention in a side column.

This will be a present for her on her 9th birthday. It looks very straight forward and direct, which children need as kids are very literal. It goes over self care such as washing your face, cleaning your body (including armpits), a little on having your period, and that type of thing. I think it's very well-written and perfect for curious, developing children (especially kids who might be shy about speaking about it at first).

I make sure to give these types of books to my daughters to look through by themselves to begin with, then a few days later, ask to sit and read it with them. We read parts, some of my choosing and some of theirs. It makes it easy to open your child up to discussing difficult topics, and letting them look through the book in private allows them to get used to the book's contents without feeling put on the spot. I think it eases embarrassment and discomfort, if there is any on the topic(s).

Remember to listen to your child, and in sensitive situations like this, don't dominate with your knowledge or influence. Listen, and ask, ""What do you think?"" And before you say anything mom-ish or dad-ish, say, ""Would you like advice?"" or ""Would you like to hear my opinion?"" If they say no, hang onto that thought and bring it up again later (the next day, etc). The goal is to make your child comfortable with themselves, and with being able to come to you with questions about their developing lives and bodies, and if they think you'll talk all over them, they won't do it. So far, this is working well for me and my kids, and they feel very comfortable asking questions and talking about puberty with me and my husband/their dad.","Bought for my daughter, turning 9",1374451200,
