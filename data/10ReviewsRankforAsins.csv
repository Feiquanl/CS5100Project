Kennen,"Willow is a genius who's observational skills and medical prowess make Sherlock Homes and House, MD look like amateurs. A lover of life, she is a gifted horticulturalist. What she's not so good at, however, is understanding how people work. Which is too bad because, having the particularly horrendous luck of being orphaned twice, she must now navigate through unimaginable pain and loss while unmoored to any particular community.

Except... maybe Willow does have more support than she first realizes, from the most unlikely sources: a taxi driver who thinks she's his guardian angel; an inept, angry guidance counselor; and a Vietnamese family who live in the garage behind their mother's nail salon.

Willow thinks so differently than most people that I can imagine some young readers will find her offputting... at first. But her quirks and logic are entirely endearing and soon begin to feel natural... to everyone, except Willow herself. Her first person narrative is divided by third-person glimpses at the people who's world she's changing... and who are changing her world.
This was a compulsive read - the 300-odd pages just sailed beneath my fingertips. Author Holly Goldberg Sloan does an amazing job of bringing the statistical anomaly that is Willow to life, and of making her feelings and actions seem realistic, while somehow retaining a lightness and hope even in Willow's darkest hours.

Willow might not resonate with every young reader, but to those she does, she will not soon be forgotten.",A Cumpulsive Read,1380240000,,,0.5,21.0,Counting by 7s

Everything is written like the protagonist is reading it from a book or holding a speech, it gets annoying really quick (and all from the perspective of a teenage kid *sigh*). Maybe it is because it is a YA novel, yet I have read plenty of other YA novels that don't have this problem.

The story is great however, it's got some surprising twists, and is well thought of. I will probably read the sequal for the sake of the story, but it is going to be hard work getting through it.","Tell, don't show",1390435200,,,0.9,25.0,Steelheart (The Reckoners)

Being that I saw the movie long before reading the book , I enjoyed it for the most part except until the end Katniss seemed whiny and childish . She's supposed to be 16 & the sole provider for her family . Example , during the games Katniss being severely upset with the death of Foxface .

More interesting stuff , the moat annoying and unnerving part of the book was probably Katniss's unlikable whining . Why I continued to read it is beyond me because I DID like it !!! But I loved the movie so much with my obsession with it that I had to continue reading !!
